69,fmdi8sh,comment,1585968501.0,2,"Strongly disagree. The fact that there is no ""I give up without trying"" button forces most people to develop ""last stand"" mentality and try riskier moves like buying rapier or a backdoor push. It is better play another 5 min with a chance to win than watch people to stay at base spamming surrender button. I believe it will only increase toxicity, since there will be a way to lower team moral by telling that there is a mechanic and we have to use it. And pressing decline every other minute will only annoy and distract.

>People can already give up on the game in more ""creative"" ways

There is a report for this. Not very effective, but still a way to fight

>People already try to harass teammates into abandoning which is even worse than harassing

There is a mute for this. Just tell them to mute, its not physical harassment after all

>If you're afraid of teammates giving up prematurely, that's because you're in a bad behavior score bracket.

Try to improve your score, so you can stop thinking about concede button. And if you are trying to lower toxicity in low score bracket its futile. They have low score for a reason and should be boiling in the same cauldron.

Edit: LOL is a different game. Mostly snowbally, rigid and comeback mechanic is practically nonexistent and surrender button kinda make sense, but I still wish there was no such button.

Alternatively save buyback, push all the lanes up, then fort your creep wave and full commit up the hill with NS ultimate to give vision. If you can catch even 1-2 of them with your NS running interference you can probably get the kill or two you need to break high ground, or worst case scenario two of your heroes kill the tower while the others screen for them without fully committing.

That said yeah, you picked a lineup where your best tower hitter uphill is a witch doctor, so you’re going to have notable difficulty breaking high ground. Basically any ranged core in existence would have made your job so much easier by giving you a way to damage towers without needing to full commit.",2020-04-04 01:14:08

By comparison, Crystalys is 34 damage for 2130. The active is also pretty nice since generally people try to ignore or disable people with blade mail up rather than fight into them. That's 4.5 seconds of freedom, and since her blink is on a 6 second cooldown maxed out, she can jump in, pop her burst, use blademail, and jump out with reduced risk.

That could be that there’s a bit of a jump as you move from the 10k “perfect” level down even a little, though.

It is worthwhile to note that behavior score actually updates on a game by game basis, despite you getting reports much less often.

Neither is my ethnicity because my ethnicity doesn't reflect more important factors that influence purchasing - i.e. people of different ethnic backgrounds don't necessarily make different purchases *because* of their ethnicity. 

I'd agree with income being more relevant but even then, the survey's objective as described by OP is to learn more about players' history with the game and their cosmetic preferences (as a function of that). I don't need to disclose my income to disclose how much I spent on Dota - or my history with the game.

As a gamer myself, I figured that an IGN is something that anyone you play with can see, and thus I saw it as information that someone wouldn't try to keep private, but I understand now why people have an issue with it. I apologize if my questionnaire made you uncomfortable in anyway, it is just for my class project. I do not plan on using the information for my own benefit or making it public to anyone. What I will be turning in is an analysis of my findings as well as some visualizations made in Tableau, none of which will contain IGN.

549,fmcnbck,comment,1585948984.0,2,"I'll be honest completely, this just my opinion but after what I've been through in Dota 2 which includes every single experience had till now. 

* Well Dota 2 I don't know where to begin but I'll keep it short. 

* Game is alive till now just because of it's strong mentally natured player base which never ever ever stopped supporting the game or gave up on it, Valve acknowledging this they are not quitting on Dota either unlike Blizzard who shuts every single Esports when they feel like it without giving a damn about their Esports scene and it's fanbase or player
base. 

* Even though all this I won't deny that Valve has sometimes done terrible cash grab projects in Dota 2 and 2019's battle pass is a prime example of it, it was the shittiest Battlepass of all the time IMO -

 I feel like I wasted my 6k on jyst to support TI prize pool, which paid off but I just felt that I didn't get anything after all these year's even if I'm sticking with Dota since Dota 1 day's I have beautiful memories with this game, me and my friends playing it the local cafe's for hour's and hour's without any care if the world, I even remember when I played straight for 2 day's while eating only fast food and having carbonated drinks but that was just me and my friends it still is a beautiful game there's no doubt about but only time I feel rewarded is when I win the match other than that I've no motivation to play it after losing teo matches unlike I used to before. Plus just saving the game I even tried hooking my friends to Dota 2 but they had the bitterst experience of their lifetime in this game, in the unranked and herald bracket it was a free roam fir Smurfs I literally saw a guy with 100 and more winning streaks that day and not to mention after getting stomped by them (obviously) my team with mic started to flame each other even my friends the vulgur language, the smurfs, bad match experience just kept demotivating them until they gave me an ultimatum 

""Bro I can't play this game man it's too hard and plus the player's of this gane are too harsh on each we can't handle toxicity, I mean who would even wanna feel bad about their selves, some even called me the N word, quoted on my intellect and used racial slurs against me out of the frustration plus there are always more skilled player's in my match who play like player's and then talk down to us, all I felt whilst playing this was hatred and disgust... I'm sorry but we have to drop this game...""

 No #SaveDotaWithMemes bullshit was going to stop them I even tried sneakily to get them to play again but no... Man have I felt alone after that... But Nonthless I don't know what to point at anymore, I don't even know what I'm saying, I just wanted to type my mind out. 

Either way peace out I don't care if I get flamed after this but in opinion these are the facts that I've discovered over the year's of playing.

 I seriously have no solution to offer because Valve is so passive about everything, check out the recent events for example they showed everyone the ray of hope by communication but in the end it was all for naught because it has offered no resolution on many matters till now not a single issue has solved plus all I can see what Valve call work is bunch of random loop patches after patches to keep monkeys busy like reduce thus and that and make it equal again, nerf this and that, then buff it back and maje broken again and bug's are the cherry on the top, plus the best April 1st joke is current patch in which we are 6.78 but we just have bunch of new heroes, items, skill trees and outpost.

And they blame the supports “No wards/GG support” even it is easier to put a ward where you farm...And you are complaining about new matchup system ... Will take another year for low mmr to understand you cant counter the mid player unless you are last pick... I have been playing this game for 1 year already... I can say 0 progress on mmr...Now with new matchup system i think i will go 0 mmr very fast ... The problem i see here is there is not any help from mods in low mmr... I have to wait again now 1 year to recalibrate again and to prove my self that i am a good player... Low mmr it is a nightmare.. 0 IQ for mostly of players that i am on team,2020-04-03 20:57:22

627,fmdp0wa,comment,1585973656.0,1," Generally I think of the learning process like this. Find something to test, think about it, then test it. After this you evaluate, improve and repeat this.  

If you are using educational resources, the orders of thinking are a good pointer as to what you need to do. You want to first get some info, or remember it.   

You need to try and understand the information. Think ""what does this all mean."" Think of ways to apply your newfound knowledge, and do that.  

When you play like trash analyse your game. Did it go well? Did you make a mistake? Then, evaluate what you can do next game. Maybe recognising a dead lane earlier, or just pulling more.  This is what I've found to work, and I think many others have.

631,fmc086l,comment,1585936469.0,1,"By feeding on the enemy, I don't just mean ganks and kills.

It means abusing the mistakes they made. Maybe they left a lane empty, you can push and farm that. Maybe they are running on 5v5 adventures, you can rat out a lane. Maybe they didn't buy enough tangoes in lane, you can harass agressively.

Check your replays, see your perspective, see enemy perspective. What did they do wrong in lane? What did you do wrong in lane?

Learn to last hit. Trust me you don't know how to.

A Smurf can end a game 0/0/0. They didn't get fed. Instead, they fed themselves on the mistake you made.

Your enemies arent harassing you in lane? Go freefarm, rush treads and battlefury, and stop making 4 wraith bands.

Your enemies are running at you all over the map? Make them run more. Let your teammates free farm in the time being.

Your enemies are pushing down mid? Go cut a wave. Go rat another lane. Go take rosh. Buy a SOD, scream to your team on mic, and run behind the enemy and kill the dudes who are alone.

Buy spirit vessel for that annoying Alchemist who's raping your ass. Buy ghost scepter for that jugger who just doesn't stop pressing R. Buy BKB because FUCK YOU LION.

There's so much you can do. So many mistakes to get farm out of.

Dota in the end, is about gaining an advantage. That advantage can be achieved through kills, last hits, and most importantly, objectives. 

Buy your own wards, ward their jungle, go kill that afk jungle Ursa.

As for heroes, you can play wraith king I guess. Hero farms decently fast, doesn't require much skill to learn how to play. And you have a free life.

Just send a bunch of skelletons down a lane while tbe enemy is fighting elsewhere. Watch them take down t1s and t2s, with the added benifit of you not even being there!

721,fmbwbga,comment,1585934410.0,1,"I agree that Dota has changed, but there are a lot of misconceptions you have about it's current state.

 Supports with net worth equal to position 2-3 means either that they didn't support or that the position 2-3 got stomped. Picks and counters have always been crucial for the game. BKB is still a very useful item. Support with Blink Dagger insta-winning game is simply not true(not sure where you got that impression from). Outposts indeed encourage more fighting, but I personally think that's better compared to farming meta. Games are indeed more stompy because of the fighting/pushing meta, but timings are still very important and ""whoever wins early wins the game"" is not true. You explained why it isn't true with the comeback mechanic.

About the smurfs, griefers and the new players' experience, I agree. Hope Valve does something about these issues.

Also they priorities farming woods too much while there is a free lane or your teammates are fighting or the enemy team are showing 4 heroes. If you don't want to be a dead weight while you are farming try to push the lanes as much as possible without dieing ofc. Add those to your and i think you will start to climb. Also consider pulling yourself while laning if the support is not doing it or even after the laning stage. For if there isn't alot of places that you can farm and you are farming at the offlane, you can pull the hard camp so next waves will meet closer to the river and you will feel safer i think.",2020-04-03 16:59:15
784,fmbwbwm,comment,1585934417.0,1,"1. it depends on your hero, if its a hero that needs a certain item before you can truly fight then its best to keep farming unless its an obvious fight that you can join fast and wrap up, such as the enemy diving your teams towers and your team is already fighting them.

BUT you need to be joining fights after 17 mins so focus on your farming and check at which times the hero you play needs to be getting his items. 

&#x200B;

2. pay attention to how your team fights are going, if you notice that you guys are winning the team fights then you are doing things right, if you notice that you guys lost one team fight because you focused the wrong hero, then consider changing your target, for example suppose you focused their cores instead of their supports, lets say you didn't focus dazzle for example and he shallow graved their core and that made a huge difference, then next time you need to focus dazzle.

&#x200B;

but usually you really want to hit their supports first, do what the enemy doesn't want you to do, if their frontliner wants you to hit him, then ignore him and hit their backlines.",2020-04-03 17:20:17

929,fmd8kir,comment,1585961771.0,1,"This is Dota2 , it's crazy and anything can work. Look at the draft , I picked MK first simply because I wanted to learn about this hero (in an unranked match) and how others counter it (coz in my bracket when you first pick a hero 2-3 enemies will draft just to counter you). When I saw rest of my team's picks , I had already decided that this game won't be a typical lesson on MK , but a lesson on space creation.   I had exactly in mind what I was going to do . (Started the game claiming to be the best MK player in the server in all chat even though I am shit on this hero). Just being annoying early game made me their no.1 target  . Why do I think I can do all of it with MK? Because of tree dance I can show up in lane and waste their time just by making them find me . With Jingu mastery I can mess with their judgement (it even happed twice in a game with a relatively farmed Sniper and Morph)  . A combination of these skills just enables that either I keep their key hero busy or they use more than one of their  heroes and important spells on me ,which is a win in my books. Just look at their draft and tell me what happens when they group up after laning stage and meet my underfarmed WK ,LD and glass cannon Lina and Zeus. You must be new to the concept of outplaying your opponent so let me explain this to you son . Outplaying your opponent is when you make them do things that you want and  already have a counter ready . From carry MK to space creator , I see this as creative problem solving on the go .And the win (with a divine rapier WK ) shows it was well executed . I understand my bracket and I outplayed them , problem occurs only when I climb up and cannot respond to enemies with higher game sense . Which in fact is more likely to happen to rigid brained toxic people like you who ask a random stranger to leave Dota2 just because he picked position 4 MK in an unranked Match. And just to show that I ain't stupid like you claim , Go watch this -  I have done the same thing as position 3 Abbadon in a match recently (Match ID 5310239055) and was relatively successful coz Abbadon is built for that.",2020-04-04 00:56:11

944,fmbbzkg,comment,1585923235.0,0,"I think this is the most popular opinion around here. As a 10k BS player in SEA, I find arguing roles overrated. I encounter only 1/100 games where there's a dual mid, or a tiny airlines. There are way more games with someone not playing their role in ranked roles by not fulfilling what their role should do. For example, pos3 carry, pos4 refusing to ward, pos5 Pudge.

The way we resolve this is for the mid player to instapick their role first, since everyone is almost the same MMR, and get countered, so people who want to play mid have to be really good otherwise they get reported. And next goes for carry. This ranked roles system just allows everyone to play core regardless of whether they are good or not. They just need to have enough time to queue, and weak players nowadays have more time to queue. Ranked roles just make people babies and think that everyone deserve to play core, without caring that it actually lowers the game quality and high MMR support's time because nobody is actually good core nowadays. They are just winning or losing based on luck and the matchmaker's algorithm.",2020-04-03 14:13:55

However both spin and omni slash are undispellable and since jugger is a last pick the hero pretty much auto wins lane. And im not talking about just auto winning vs batrider. All offlaners in general are auto lost vs jugger because there is nothing you can do besides stand ur ground and trying to do auto attacks vs a magic immune hero that is doing 400 damage at level one. This is one of the examples where certain heroes are just have such an advantage that skill is a nonfactor and there is nothing you can do about it.,2020-04-03 13:59:07

1026,fmc6zpg,comment,1585940075.0,1,I completely agree with you. The value of cheap early game items is really good right now. Even just tossing a windlace into your empty slot is super good. After 20 minutes I'm regularly shuffling things in and out of my back pack. And as a support rushing a big naked item leads to more losses than wins.

I would say it's a level 6 power spike on par with Kunkka except it's insanely underutilized. It doesn't matter if you died twice before level 6. At level 6, you almost certainly have kill threat on the enemy midlaner. You should also stack neutral camps and take them with level 3-4 flame guard. 

Once you get your first item (phase boots or urn), and find a proper rune( haste dd invis arcane) gank a sidelane that you think has kill potential on the enemy laner. Make a quick kill and then back to farming unless you see another good opportunity.  

Ember NEEDS to have a good game to have a solid amount of impact and solo carry. The best way to ensure this is to snowball off the back of killing heroes and towers. If you can time your rotation around the 10 minute siege cart timing, then you'll probably get a sidelane tower as well, opening the map up and allowing you to make more rotations and game aggressively.",2020-04-03 20:44:02

Also I noticed you said phase boots urn, I almost always go treads.. and why urn? I understand it if you want to transition into vessel for an alch or morph etc. Is urn/vessel really that good? Has felt underwhelming to me.

1100,fmdhici,comment,1585967961.0,1,"Honestly you shouldn't be so rigid in your skill build. Chains has been buffed off late and i always take a value point at any level from 1-3. I normally take a point in q and w before maxing e. It's really useful. 

When you're close enough that you'll get 6 from the next creep wave what you do is; shove the lane using flame guard and get your six, now the enemy creeps are hitting the enemy, he's also taking damage from your right clicks and flame guard. A quick chains at this point is almost always confirmed kill as it traps him there taking damage from the creeps and you. This also works anytime you're able to shove the lane in and the enemy mid can't. Most level 1-6 heroes can't tank damage from the creep wave and ember. I'd recommend doing it around level 3-4.
It may not work every time but it's a hint that could help with getting kills against the enemy mid. 

I don't usually get wraith bands on ember unless I'm safelane(i think getting 2 is a waste of gold). I always get phase cuz of the armour, movement speed(helps chase down AND run away) and damage. 

I get treads if I lose my lane while playing safelane. I go vessel most games as there's always some sorta strength hero (bristle, tide, underlord etc) or morph, alche, monkey king etc. I think it's just a really strong item in general too.

Siege timings are important if you're a midlaner. I'd recommend focussing on that. 

All this being said, I'm honestly not that high mmr(divine 3 rn) and only have like 100~ ember games with a 55~% winrate. If you get advice from someone better I would take it.",2020-04-04 02:39:21
1101,fmdnic6,comment,1585972453.0,1,"That's a great point. I do typically get aggressive with a higher creep count and will drawn aggro alot to increase damage, with my goal being to get him low for an easy kill with sof, at my rank not many people buy then so it's kinda easy. But an early chains would help a tonne I think know that you've mentioned that..

What's your lane like with harder match ups where you can't threaten a kill? Like against a sniper/Zeus etc. Treads game with tonnes of neutral stacking? 
Oh, I thought stat builds were the meta ATM? Good to know.
What's your item build after phase vessel? This is where I'll get confused.

1102,fmds2gw,comment,1585976196.0,1,"Against heroes like Zeus with high magic burst but low armour i get maybe 2 points in guard and max sof. I'll get a blight stone too and just harass. Wand is a must in such lanes. You just get exp and farm as much as you can until you're 6. Once you're 6 lina, zeus, od(if he misplays) are all ez kills. You just need to not die and get as much as you can until your 6. Once youre 6 it's an ez kill on them with sof and chains. Maybe you wait for a good rune(dd, arcane, haste) and just kill them under their tower. Ofc you gotta use your remnants right to dodge their spells and tower hits. 

There are very few lanes where ember cannot threaten a kill if you're not too far behind in terms of exp and gold. Even in a disadvantageous lane, you just get what farm you can and cs patiently until your 6. If you feel like the enemy laner is better, you max flame guard and stack for yourself. Once you have your boots of choice, just go gank. I'd recommend phase boots 100% of the time if you're going mid. 

You dont necessarily HAVE to stack a ton with treads, it's just good stats and gives you better mana management with switching.

I've literally never seen that and stole multiple items from opponents who were farming around a ward and I was close enough to snag it away. Shovel is one of the best Tier 1 items because it's useful the whole game, you can keep that in your backpack and switch it in when you have a few free moments, or you're near a shop, and use it.

I think the only legit way to ""fix"" this issue is to add that neutral items only drop when a friendly hero (excluding all the hero units that can't pick up items) are in close proximity. The range of how far the hero should be at least above the average attack and cast range (I think 1300-1500 units would be fair).",2020-04-04 01:42:14

Since they released a game which is a big rip off (community is enraged and whole thing is a big fiasco) you can't start w3 classic through [battle.net](https://battle.net) client anymore.

There is a work-around by installing  Warcraft® III: Public Test Realm but it requires a CD key which I didn't get (the game would be authorized over [battle.net](https://battle.net) client) and now I am stuck without option to play w3 classic even tough I spent 30€. I guess I could go through the hassle of contacting customer support but I don't care tbh.

Long story short - if you have your original CD key just go to  [https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/download](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/download)  and download Warcraft® III: Public Test Realm and you should be gucci. Otherwise, you'll have to download w3 classic elsewhere.",2020-04-03 22:54:08

1327,fmbktkq,comment,1585928337.0,1,">I mean sure you get level advantage for a brief moment but it doesn't really matter. 

Except it does, because Mars Rubick getting level 2 before Slark Witch Doctor(off the top of my head examples) means that the whole dynamic of the lane changes. It can mean the difference between burning a salve of your own and burning their salves.

>And the enemy is under tower anyway so you can't really kill him.

If you know how to leverage your 2 spell advantage, you can. And even if you don't kill him, you win the regen war and the XP war by zoning him.

> And you don't just ''freely'' harass under tower if the enemy keeps the creeps at certain spot.

That's the point, it's impossible to keep them ""at a certain spot"" if you just shove it in. They will have nothing to aggro but the opponents. Not to mention that you can use abilities on the heroes and the tower won't aggro you, so that means the creeps will freely tank the tower for you. Also into discussion comes the fact that it's just a bad trade for the enemy to trade into a lane full of creeps while they have none. Only Axe and Legion really want to fight in an enemy creep wave.",2020-04-03 15:38:57
1328,fmbp2xh,comment,1585930616.0,1,"Using your example Mars and Rubick gaining lvl 2 faster than Slark and WD will do absolutely nothing when Slark and WD are standing under tower with most likely full hp and you had to use spells to get the lane to push in the first place.

You win the xp war by denying and not letting the enemy get close to creeps. You can't do that if the creeps are under their tower.

It's definitely possible to keep the creeps at a spot that is out of enemies auto attack reach.",2020-04-03 16:16:56

1. You can push the lane easily by just shoving it with autoattacks.

2. The secret to actually pushing the lane is aiming your spells so you hit creeps AND heroes at the same time.

3. This ties into point #2, but they will never be full HP and mana when the lane is shoved.

4. Even if they are full HP and mana, by focusing 4 spells on one single hero, that hero most likely dies, and if he doesn't he just burns through most of his regen.

>You win the xp war by denying and not letting the enemy get close to creeps.

This works only in lanes that are so lopsided level 1 that the enemy literally cannot contest whatsoever. And even then, creep aggro exists, meaning that bad comes to worse, it comes down to 50/50s.

>You can't do that if the creeps are under their tower.

You don't need to.

>It's definitely possible to keep the creeps at a spot that is out of enemies auto attack reach.

After they are shoved under the tower and the enemy creep wave doesn't exist, it's impossible. What are creeps going to aggro if they can't aggro creeps? Heroes or towers. If they aggro the tower, they tank it, if they aggro the heroes, they tank the tower AND hit the heroes. And if the heroes pull the creeps further away from the tower that means they literally have no safe spot anymore.",2020-04-03 16:34:37
1330,fmbsooz,comment,1585932497.0,1,"I literally just said, if you are going to push with just auto attacks, enemies should match the push so the creep wave stays just outside of their tower aggro.

Not all heroes can hit creeps and heroes at the same time.

Yeah if that hero is afk. There's also another hero in the lane whose job is to not let you freely blow all your spells in to the other. Using the example: Rubick and Mars with lvl 1 spear and rebuke + lvl 1 fade bolt and lift are not going to do enough damage. Especially when Slark is under tower. Now if they kept the lane at a decent spot, they might actually be able to score an easy kill on Witch doctor or maybe even kill Slark.

Xp zoning is only a thing in one sided lanes but denying is always doable.

Oh no the creeps did less than one tango worth of damage but in trade I got all of those last hits safely under tower.",2020-04-03 16:48:17

I regularly get into games where there are one or two people desperately trying to get everyone's attention by being hurtful, insulting or just blaming others for their own bad decisions. But you can count that by getting into the chat early and trying to mentally support the other players that aren't causing problems.
Had a game recently where two of us randomed and the one guy had never played his hero before. Just a little encouragement and advice (when asked for) turned it into a stomp.
Now, this story is one case and it doesn't always work. But if you can believe going back in time and changing one small thing can change the world, then why can't one small action you make now change the future?",2020-04-03 11:15:33

In ranked, calibration takes 10 games and puts you in your skill bracket very quickly with a good initial value taken from your previous games. I would say for a new account it should start balancing after around 20 games and the number of smurfs should decrease.",2020-04-03 10:46:40

Costs for a child don't keep increasing every year. If your kid is 18 and living at home or 25/6/7/8 doesn't really make a difference anymore. It's not like black had to fly every other week to all those tournaments he qualified for.  I reckon it's mostly about whether his parents are willing to spend the money on him and not on themselves and that's entirely their decision to make.

It will give you an idea of things that pros do that can help you improve your game. Focus on a role you like ie. pos 5. Compare what you saw the pros doing to what you are doing (only focus on YOUR role otherwise you will tilt yourself very quickly)

The toughest part for returning players is learning to rotate esp. as pos 4. This is important because off lane can sometimes be a dead lane so knowing you are more useful in other lanes compared to staying in lane trying to resuscitate it. The other aspect that will be difficult to grasp is when to fight / smoke gank.

Try to limit the amount of heroes you play to 3-4 that are in the meta or heroes you feel comfortable playing. And go from there :)

1619,fmayk1r,comment,1585912815.0,-5,"As one of the people who has played the hero, the most since release (251 games). The hero is without a doubt super strong in many aspects of the game. However, you can't do everything with the hero in every position, and void spirit has some conditions to be met, before he can fly off during a match. This is the reason why he is not overpowered.

Void spirit is a hero who shines with skill. And sucks if you do not know how to play him. I would paraphrase him to an unnerfed genji in overwatch. Since what makes him seem to do everything is when the person playing the hero knows exactly what to do in every situation.

Things to be clear

- the hero is definitely strong, but not op, but feels op when you are playing against it.

- the hero is very punishable

- he is very cooldown reliant

- his strength lies in his versatility, but he is weak in a speciality. He is never the best carry, the best support, the best mid or offlaner, but he can fit in all the roles.

When you think of heroes, think of tradeoffs. What does the hero lack, for the strength the hero has.

All the arguments you've presented in this post can also be applied to invoker with his 9 abilities. But the reality is not so simple",2020-04-03 11:20:15

If he can't win his lane he has to kill stacks so his position on the map can be guessed early. He needs rune control to maintain mana for flash farm. He needs to rotate and gank if he loses his lane, hard to do with no items. 

Have to beat him min 0-10 and take his tower then take map control super early. That's why he sucks vs DP. she doesn't counter him per se but plays a different game of Dota than he does. Her 6 is T1 mid, she flash farms just as fast and has an eternal silence that fucks his teamfight in the ass if he gets caught. If you play DP and every ulti is a tower you will win the dota game and void has to play around you. You are also a natural Euls carrier and can purge his E.

Edit: Seems like nobody here has ever gone beyond high school so I'll drop some links for you to educate yourselves.

This pandemic is not an avian influenza but avian influenza is a very similar threat, perhaps even more dangerous. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza?wprov=sfla1

>Five manmade ecosystems have contributed to modern avian influenza virus ecology: integrated indoor commercial poultry, range-raised commercial poultry, live poultry markets, **backyard and hobby flocks**, and bird collection and trading systems including cockfighting. Indoor commercial poultry has had the largest impact on the spread of HPAI, with the increase in HPAI outbreaks largely the result of increased commercial production since the 1990s.

Yes having fucking live poultry living in your third world house is a sanitary risk, who would have thought. I'm willing to bet most of these downvotes are from other third world kids who don't get it.",2020-04-03 06:07:57

1866,fmbb6ar,comment,1585922736.0,2,"I think it might be that Euls damage happens first. I know that False Promise doesn't heal or deal damage when the target is hidden or invulnerable. Instead, it waits for these effects to finish before applying delayed damage and heal. 

So perhaps Eul's damage is applied before False Promise? I have no idea how it used to work, so it might still be a bug.",2020-04-03 14:05:36
1867,fma8bxo,comment,1585886451.0,3,"In the clip troll takes no damage while affected by false promise, getting big amounts of healing instead. However since he was 10 hp during false promise, euls ends up killing troll as soon as false promise ends, negating all the healing oracle did during the ultimate. Being close to 1 hp is pretty common with troll too, so it's not even that rare of a situation to happen.",2020-04-03 04:00:51
1868,fmac1gf,comment,1585889402.0,-8,"I think the problem here is the damage actually is more than the heal.

Since you've pressed soul ring so much, your heals are completely worthless.

A way to prove this is by casting nullifier on a hero which is false promsied, then spamming purifying flames. Purying flames can kill your ally.

This is the same thing with soul ring.

So basically, it is not a bug. It is just a weird interaction.",2020-04-03 04:50:02

1871,fmad6jz,comment,1585890375.0,7,"How does soul ring have anything to do with this whole interaction? It was just a way i used to get low health fast without dying, and should have 0 effect on the ultimate and the outcome of heal/damage.

1872,fmahc7m,comment,1585894155.0,5,"No, the bug---and this is not new---is that the order of actions is (1) false promise HP lock ends (during the euls/tornado/whatever), (2) landing damage is applied, and (3) false promise differential heal/damage is applied.  What needs to happen is for the false promise differential to be applied immediately when the HP lock ends, regardless of the invulnerability state of the hero when that happens, at least from any observable standpoint.  It CERTAINLY should not allow anything else to interpose between the two events.",2020-04-03 06:09:15

1913,fmb0o7s,comment,1585914868.0,8,"Good job! Some feedback..  the perspective on the axe (not the character) looks a bit off. And the surface looks pretty flat (I understand you dont want to bring focus on that part since it is 'blurred', but it could benefit with a bit more detail.

I'm not really sure I understand where you want us to focus. I think you could stick to just one focus point, which will make the image pop a lot better. Right now Axe right hand looks very detailed and crisp, so does his head and parts of his left hand. This makes it hard for me to find a place to draw my eyes towards.  Maybe I would focus more on his face and upper part of his torso and make that more of a focal point (since  you already have lots of detail in the face and the hair looks nice). 

The stomach / six pack looks a bit weird. The shadow under his left ribcage is a bit too deep, which makes the stomach look like it has been ripped off all skin / fat and that we are actually looking at his organs / muscle tissue.

I think it is a really great start and a piece that could potentially be beautiful, but it needs some love :). Really like your vibe.

I dont know if you do this, but try flipping the image vertically to see it out of a different angle if you have been staring yourself ""blind"" on it.",2020-04-03 11:54:28

Mostly I think the entire pose is very un-Axelike and I love it. But the colours just don't mix well making this not easy on the eye. I am not good enough to guess what would look well, but personally I'd just desaturate the blue a little to make it not hurt the eye as much",2020-04-03 19:43:07

Colours are hard. Ive been a working artist for nearly 10 years and its hard. But there are ways to fake it. One thing i would suggest doing is going to adobes colour theme website or coolors, google them. Then pick 2 or 3 colours from Axe, that you've painted, and the website will pick colours that match the colour scheme. 

Then just repaint your background  using your new colour palette and bo! Harmonious painting.",2020-04-04 02:11:52

2048,fm9zunq,comment,1585880382.0,5,"So in basic order this is what I’d be doing as a support:

1) Wards/sentries. Vision is super important while losing, though you should be careful. If you know five enemies are in your jungle a lot it’s better to go ward elsewhere instead of dying and then being instantly countered.

2) Can you get a pick yourself? Buy a smoke, then find your offlaner or your other support. Say, “lets gank” into chat, wait for them to finish their current creep camp, and then blow smoke on their face. Most allies will happily follow you at that point and it usually only takes 2-3 heroes to pick off a solo enemy. This is also one of the best ways to get back into games! Just keep in mind that the gank has to go fast. If you’re having to chase your target then you need to just let them get away because the rest of their team is coming to murder you.

3) If there are waves not being shoved out, shove them. Don’t steal farm, and keep in mind that sometimes it’s better to let one lane stay pushed so your carries can farm it, but elsewise run up to a wave in a more dangerous location, nuke it quickly, then run away.

4) If none of these apply, find your carry that is currently in the most dangerous position and stand near them (maybe farm the small creep camp while you wait). With any luck when they get ganked you’ll be able to save them or at least sacrifice yourself to buy them time to escape.",2020-04-03 02:19:42
2049,fmacpbg,comment,1585889962.0,1,"The general idea of playing on the losing side is to make as space as much as possible. I know someone has already talked about this, but to put simply you want to play in the most dangerous place possible, where you can still farm. 

Even if this means cutting the wave, then so be it. Every time you force a tp, then you can take a fight against them. You want to fight 4v5, or in extreme cases 3v5 rather than their entire time. 

Teams in the lower bracket have absolutely no idea how to split push. So if you split push, its an easy ride out of that place.",2020-04-03 04:59:22

2070,fm9z6rc,comment,1585879931.0,1,"Ogre magi is a great first hero, as is Jakiro for an alternative.

CM also get suggested a lot, but personally I suggest skipping her until later since she’s really slow and squishy.

It’s generally a good idea to mainly stick to 1-2 heroes when you first start. That said I also highly suggest occasionally picking a different heroes instead (though you should check them out in practice mode first so you don’t need to read all their skills in the middle of the game). By doing this it helps you learn what all of the different heroes do (which is one of the biggest hurdles to clear at the start of the game), plus occasionally you’ll find a hero that is really fun to play that you would have missed out on otherwise!",2020-04-03 02:12:11

2072,fmauxzr,comment,1585908829.0,1,"Ogre is one of my favorite heroes. Can be played from pos 5-3 and works well in all of them. Great hero for beginners too cause of his tankiness so you can make more mistakes than you would be able to with someone like CM or Lich. Just level up your E and spam it on your carry in lane and chase out enemies with your tanky body and your Q / W .

Tip : Only rush midas if you had a good lane. Otherwise skip it for items like glimmer, force staff, etc if you're pos 4 / 5.",2020-04-03 10:13:49

2076,fma0vd0,comment,1585881086.0,1,"Doom isn’t necessarily the best since you have to know what abilities the different neutral creeps have (since devour gives you those skills) and his attack animation is rather slow. He’s also much more of an 3 (offlaner core) than a 4 (offlane support).

That said he’s a pretty tanky hero that’s pretty straightforward beyond the neutrals thing (both of which are very important for new players) so you definitely could pick worse heroes as your main one to learn on! I’d say you’d probably be okay doing it, just be aware that it’s probably better to try to get into that 3 slot rather than the 4 one as you start to get a little bit better.",2020-04-03 02:31:26

2078,fma3td9,comment,1585883122.0,1,Ogre and Jakiro both can play either 4 or 5 (safelane support). Ogre can really go either though tends to change his item build somewhat (Midas is only a 4 thing). Jakiro is usually 5 but if needed can definitely play 4 instead.,2020-04-03 03:05:22

Bot games can also be a thing to try until you have the extreme basics down. Purge is also doing a series right now where he’s helping coach a very low skill player that might be a helpful watch.

Beyond that it’s just a matter of playing and not being afraid to mute people. After your first 10 games things will get a bit better balanced because the system will have calibrated your score somewhat, but it’s still a bit of a long road.

My other big suggestion is to don’t be afraid to send party/friend invites to people that are nice. They might not always accept, but having a couple of positive people to queue with can go a *long* way towards making things more tolerable.",2020-04-03 01:25:18

As for heroes. You are generally fucked unless you have a spammable aoe like necro, lina or dp with their q. Wolves give lycan a high amount of last hittting power and he has regen from feral impulse. You need very heavy harass to zone him ( say a skywrath or something )

Considering sf against lycan in mid lane, raze him to death. You can't fucking run, if you see him running at you, press all 3 razed buttons and hes done. SF can nuke pretty heavily in lane. Considering he's a melee hero, walk up and raze him along with creeps, you should be able to get off both medium and long raze. Kill the wolves in lane, its a clasic mistake letting him sit around with 80 extra damage, you should 3-4 shot wolves at equal levels with right-click, it's literally free gold

It's the same as asking what the fuck to do if you got cheesed by meepo or brood last pick and you don't have anything to kill them. You just hope you win atleast 2 lanes to deathball them.",2020-04-03 06:55:22

2162,fma0n21,comment,1585880926.0,0,"I have been spamming Lycan this month... about 50 games. Outside of a few heroes there isn’t a lot that counters him item wise. Most items single target him and then you kill them with creep army or hold the enemy down with that. You purge off ghost or glimmer with necro book or satyr. 

That being said, if you buy a midas you can instant kill his stun creep before it stuns you and TP. One sniper did that to me... Lowe’s efficiency of course if you’re waiting for lycan to come kill you but it’s an option. He also got boots of travel that allowed him to be a lot more places to stop pushes.

2175,fma72v1,comment,1585885508.0,1,"Since you are confident with SF, I believe you play the hero well, and when you know well your hero its easy to tell which heroes you're bad against.

This is one of those cases, unfortunately sometimes you just need to play together with your team and people need to gather to stop Lycan else he will just get a gold advantage for his team by taking tower after tower.

&#x200B;

As an example, I am very confident playing as Invoker and I usually get the hero when I have teammates that synergyzes with me, like a Lion, Nyx, Legion, etc.

But If I get a last pick Brood, there isn't much I can do myself and if my team doesn't respond she will kill me, get towers, sweep our jungle, etc, its the same with your matchup.

&#x200B;

Answering your question: Midas is okayish, Hurricane Pike good and BKB is the best defensive item against him since he can purge you out of Euls, Ghost, Glimmer and can see invisible units.

But if you can't get your team to work together early game there isn't too much you can do honestly, its either BKB-TP or use your ult to fear him and TP",2020-04-03 03:45:08

Why do you want to back yourself into a corner.

That being said don't over commit to fights. The only way to deal with lycan is not get ratted OR lose a team fight so hard that he groups and mows down your towers. 

Heroes like bara and legion commander (especially in a combo)are great at killing these fuckers too. I remember a smurf brood got absolutely mothered by this combo.",2020-04-03 07:29:50

The fact that I can not predict the lycan last pick is that I have to think about brood/meepo/huskar  last picks too and I found out the heroes I pick for them are not consistantly good against lycan.

Let me tell you what ranked roles update fucked up fundamentally that it affects mm right now :
1. Removing 2 separate mmrs (solo/ party) let people to boost their fiends mmr easily (or to sell)
2. Having support and core mmr ruined dota community that you had to become braindead 1 role/hero spammer
3. All that behavior score + choose 5 different roles + avoid system + trying match mmr of mid players in a match made high mmr ques go for hours. I was 6k and it would take me to find match in 30 mins at least so either had to play game way less like me or smurfing In low mmr with friends which boosts them for future losses in your games <3",2020-04-03 17:16:03

Also, learn to lure the creeps to you so you don't have to go deep just to last hit. You can do that by fake attacking the enemies to get the attention of their creeps. There are tutorials on YouTube. Purge's is a classic. As a Jugg, you have early kill potential tbh. Just spam your Q when nearby enemies but in this case, you are against tanky motherfuckers so it's kinda hard but if it were against squishy heroes, that will be easy.

You should in most cases ferry regen yourself. Keep a salve in reserve and get tangoes to trade hits. As jug, I would also recommend a mango or 2.

In laning stage you ideally want 2 or even 3 stat items before getting anything else. A general algorithm is this 

( Bracer, Wraithband/Nulltalisman , Wand ) you should depending on the situation pickup atleast 2 items from this list,  you can repeat an item like having 2 bracers.

Remember bracers are good on any hero regardless of primary attribute.

Watch a youtube video on creep aggro, you can use it to draw creeps toward yourself to secure cs and avoid harass. Also position yourself such that it is more difficult for enemy to run at you. 

Eg on radiant safelane, most supports will be standing in the centre or upper part of the lane ( towards camps ) by standing on the lower side, the enemy support will have to walk over creeps to harass you.",2020-04-03 07:24:18

2398,fmadqsm,comment,1585890865.0,2,"I genuinely feel he doesn't understand the game enough to have a stance on this.

Comebacks are easy.

As said above, stacking is NOT that risky. In fact, it can be used as a way to force the enemy to react to something they don't want anything to do with. It can be used as space, or something of efficiency. Stacking is mostly more beneficial than not, EVEN if the enemy sees it. Yes, they are getting farm but they are also losing lane farm and giving your team lane farm.

And the rubberband mechanics apply generally to killstreaks. Supports generally don't get any killstreaks, so your example of a pos 5 dying is just unfathomable in a high skill game. If you didn't know, only high skill pubs matter in terms of balance. So if the pros complain, changes happen. This just makes the game interesting however.

I hate to mmr shame, but I feel like unless you got 7k mmr, this isn't something you should be talking about. My reasoning is people lower generally don't understand the game properly, especially people in 3k. 

7.25 was just a meta patch to keep the meta interesting. Though I feel like everyone has figured out the meta pretty well by now, so we might get 7.25c soon.",2020-04-03 05:14:25

With free farm

10mins - 80

20mins - 240+

Normal lane

15mins- 100-150

20mins- 200+

Pressured lane

10mins- 50-60

15mins - 100-140

20mins- 200+


The variation is mostly in early game due to losing or winning in lane but the goal is to recover by 20mins. It is reasonable only to measure this upto 20mins or 25min as it is dedicated farming time. 

After this it can vary a lot depending on what your hero does, heroes like lycan would want to push and end the game early while naga would split push and farm some more while occasionally fighting.

In general 200+ by 20min every game and 240+ if you had good start. This also takes into consideration that you usually get a item by now which means farm speed should accelerate over time.

Heroes like naga, tb and am can farm jungle pretty fast even before 10mins. It is perfectly reasonable to leave lane if you can't farm well or have to ferry a salve every minute.",2020-04-03 07:35:01

But if you still feel games are impossible, look at Alliance's final game at TI3. Multiple buybacks(buybacks at the time were shit), absolute trash early game, a failed comeback attempt, and yet.... They won. Rubberband mechanics weren't the best back then either. I don't give a shit what the game looks like. If I know my team's win condition and can still do my job in that condition, I'll keep playing and giving it my all.  


If you're getting destroyed by Huskar Brood or Meepo, then there's something you don't fully understand about those heroes. Anyway, it's a mentality thing.

It is at least good at low mmr becouse the player pool is big enought to filter trolls and people being bad at the game make heroes more usable, but at high mmr with a lower playerbase and the importance of the draft phase it should be hell

And that is the issue, at best, **maybe** you will enjoy more the next patch, but the other problems will persist or get worse, until the next next patch comes where maybe you won't enjoy the new patch.

That's why i suggested try a different game, maybe some solo player games, or if you don't enjoy other games, try competitive games that are releasing soon, where the playerbase is fresh",2020-04-02 23:36:05

Lycan, for example, was busted but instead of reworking his ulty or the ability to spin out of the control, they decided to increase mana on Necros and lower his damage which basically slows his game slightly but does not erase the original problem. Another example is gold and XP. Instead of slowing down the meta they decided to increase gold bounties on carries so you would have a chance to turn around a game instead of once again removing the core problem. Basically, we are still 5 man brawling like before, 70% of other heroes are absolutely dead but if we kill their out of control cores somehow we may still have a chance to win, yay.",2020-04-03 15:58:44

2517,fm9ziy4,comment,1585880164.0,1,"I was archon1 and now legend2 in last 2 months. I mostly play pos4/5 and sometimes pos3. A few things really helped me:
1. Play a small pool of useful support heroes (ones that can stun are the best - I mostly play tree, aa and ogre)
2. Understanding what support actually means (keeping your cores alive, giving them space to farm and help with vision etc) it's all about doing what ever to make the game easier for your cores.
3. Following from step 2 itemization is so important. I always look at the enemy draft and see who can kill me fast (if there is pa/jugg/ursa/slark I always go quick EULs, forcestaff, ghost sceptre, glimmer Cape etc) as you can't help your team if you're picked off immediately. But you don't do this at the expense of getting vision. 
4. I communicate appropriate item choices to my cores. Ideally my pos1 should eat up enemy pos1, so I communicate items that help do that
5. People in low brackets don't go for objectives and just farm and farm, because they farm slow or don't recognise opportunities. I roll with this and get my more desired items like Midas on ogre and move to get hex. 
6. Try and be close to your cores on the map
7. In laning phase try and One out enemy core or supp. This guarantee Ur core gets farm. 
8. Mute immediately if you think you're gonna get tilted
9. Drafting is prob the most important aspect of Dota. I always try and draft such that my supp hero fills a gap. If my team indicates they are picking a melee core, I'll usually go aa for the range harass. Or I'll pick ogre if we're a bit soft.",2020-04-03 02:16:04
2518,fm977uz,comment,1585863030.0,1,"The first advice I would give to someone who only plays ""ranked solo"" on the support role is: don't play support. You rely waaaay too much on your cores to do well, and while you do have an impact on the overall game with any hero/role, still the cores are the ones who carry the team to victory. I've lost too many games where I did decent/well but my mid/carry failed miserably.

Anyway, if you wanna be a better support, learn to pull/when to pull, learn to use smokes, learn to ward properly based on what your team wanna do (play agressive/defensive/gank). Also, get items like glimmer cape, force staffs, even pipe when needed, but dont forget to use them when needed, because most of the people at low ranks OFTEN forget to use their items.",2020-04-02 21:30:30

Advice I can give is pllay suports that can farm or push well. 

Dont forget your own farm. I never used to take jungle creeps I dont just mean pulling but since taking extra exp and gold it's made massive difference. (I mean where I can not at cores expense) 

My fave ranking up suports are
Death prophet,
Shadow shaman,
Zuse,
Sand king,
Crystal,

All can farm easily and push really well. 

All depends on how you play and what your good at. Mentality will take you most of the way.

In your bracket the one hero I really smashed it with was shadow demon. It has a lower than average winrate in low mmr. But it's mostly because people dont understand it. I have 73% winrate over around 80 games. It has all the skills you need and is one of the best enabler heroes for lancing. Is has escape, burst, slow and as soon as you have aganims any team fight are easy just pop an ulti on a few diferent heroes and use disruption offensively or defensively. Killing with some one goes like this. Disrupt enemy, cast second skill while they are in the ball to take of 35%!!! Of there hp. Ultimate them so they cant runaway. Watch your core kill them with ease as they panic and run.

2526,fm9614a,comment,1585862381.0,1,"In some downtime its often good to stack, but be careful that the enemy lane cant easily take the camp or doesnt see it. Pulling very much depends on the situation, but the general guideline is of course that you want your creep wave close to your tower. What you dont want though is that the enemy creep wave is under your tower, its both hard to cs sometimes and then your wave will push again. Also dont pull when you can consistently hit their tower without too much risk^^",2020-04-02 21:19:41
2527,fma0xkj,comment,1585881128.0,1,"You're right, this takes more experience to recognise. Generally, I leave lane when my core is winning/can handle it on his own or another lane is being tower dived. 
 
There are some cores that need more babysitting than others such as spec, luna, am, or ones without an escape/easily zoned out and basically can't fight without items. Some cores can still kill without items such as ursa, Slark, bs, etc in early game. 

I stack more often depending on the core, e.g Sven, alche (ones that destroy camps fast) otherwise I get away with hardly stacking. I also stack more when I can't do much in lane and we're getting pumped. 

The lane is won generally when your core has more farm or you zoned out well/picked off enemy/forced rotations in or out. 

If it gets really bad, I leave lane and trilane somewhere else forcing rotations there. Not every situation is winnable, your core has to know how to farm and itemise too. 

I'm only low 3k (but also rising) so obviously I still have a lot to learn myself.",2020-04-03 02:32:08
2528,fm9b9ye,comment,1585865262.0,1,"I'm not saying about stacking camps, that's what you do only when your carry can handle the lane by himself, but that's rare. Pulling means you pull two camps (one by one) or just stack one, in order to keep the lane at a safe level for your carry to farm (meaning to be closer to the friendly tower, than to the enemy's).

Rosh is not important to ward until teams are strong enough to slay it. Try to keep vision on the river, near the power runes. Also use smokes if you want to ward deep, because that way the enemies can't see you, and they won't figure out you warded their jungle. You can also ward behind enemy towers, it provides good vision when they're trying to defend/coming to gank. The point is, think of ward areas that are simply NOT obvious. Low rank players ward the obvious spots/useless ones. one more thing, ward your jungle only if the enemies can put pressure on your carry. IF your team is the one domainating the game, there's no need for such a ward usually.

Anyways, I'm just an ancient player, I'm not immortal or something, so those are just my two cents. Keep practicing, watch some pro teams in action, check their supports map movement and warding, and in 1-2 months you should improve. Gl.",2020-04-02 22:07:42

After the balance patch (bugged):

20/40/60 damage per 0.5 seconds, thus 40/80/120 damage per 1.0 seconds.

After the bug fix (initially intended behaviour):

10/20/30 damage per 0.5 seconds, thus 20/40/60 damage per 1.0 seconds.

---

The balance patch said the interval was changed from 1.0 to 0.5, but usually this keeps the total damage the same, unless stated otherwise.

The damage was not adapted when the interval was changed, which caused it to deal twice the damage it was supposed to deal.

This got fixed in today’s update, same damage as before the balance patch (it just ticks twice as often, with half the damage per tick, thus same total damage).",2020-04-03 07:27:33

I quit for like 2 years and came back recently with the neutral item update and I have fun again.

I can't play other mobas because they usually have smaller spell animations/range, the map is smaller or whatever.

2726,fm8tv40,comment,1585855925.0,3,"As the game has evolved, disables keep getting stronger and stronger, and honestly, BKB just doesn't cut it, half the time.  **The biggest offender is Abyssal Blade** (and basher), against which BKB is completely useless.

Status resistance is essentially the only counter.   Sange-based items are worth considering on almost any hero now, since there are decent buildouts from it for almost anyone (halberd for example is excellent on squishy supports).  Satanic is a bit harder to justify on a certain extrema of heroes (i.e. it's always going to be a really difficult idea on Skywrath), but on many other heroes it used to be ""borderline"" on it's gotten somewhat good.   It's always been a classic on stuff like jugg and so forth, but it's becoming rather good on things like ogre or right-click lina.

&#x200B;

The dirty thing about this is that Status resistance isn't just ""your last resort"" against stuff that pierces bkb, but it's just so powerful that you frequently can ""squeak by"" and skip the BKB entirely - this is mostly because of the items they chose to put it on.   If you've got a sange and a satanic, you've got a little under 50% status resistance, so nearly all disables last half as long.  But to add insult to injury, you've also got a ton more hitpoints, so you can just tank a bunch of damage that you'd normally have to bkb to avoid because (normally) it'd be a killing blow.   Not only that, when you're near death after tanking it - you've conveniently got satanic to fill yourself right back up.

The biggest thing about status resist is it's always up; it's always actively protecting you.  You have a timing window on using the satanic active, but the passive SR and STR is just active 100% of the time.  The other thing about the items that give SR is that broadly, they're much better brawling items; if you just take the passive effects of them and compare them to BKB, you're much better at trading blows.

So yeah; there are a lot of heroes where in ""old school dota"" you'd just buy a bkb, always, but these days, you often want to get status resistance first, and see if you can get by on that alone.

Sometimes you still simply have to get a BKB - certain enemies make it mandatory.   But it's much more situational now.",2020-04-02 19:32:05
2727,fm9084v,comment,1585859266.0,1,"This is insightful. Another thing (or things). My games generally are decided by midgame A  LOT. one error, one single error in midgame and it's over. Is this actually the case currently, or I'm just imagining things. Also, there a lot of camps to farm, but no way of farming them. I find that most of my lost games, our team doesn't have access to idk, 70% of the map? The enemy takes outpost, and contest half of the camps and you choke till the killing blow is delivered. Are there certain heroes that can solve this? I believe Tinker is good at creating space, but I'm not a midlaner myself, generally I'm pos4-5, so are there certain heroes made for this?",2020-04-02 20:27:46
2728,fm92lbs,comment,1585860530.0,2,That’s why you contest enemy safe lane and ward enemy jungle and triangle so your carry farms enemies part of jungle. As dire. As radiant otherwise.,2020-04-02 20:48:50
2729,fmasvku,comment,1585906498.0,2,"oof, that's a way harder question, and I .. am also fumbling in the dark, but I'll give it a shot.  I really don't like the current map design for exactly that reason; it's easier for a winning team to just choke out the map, rather than the map being an asset for a losing team (consider some of those OG vs. LGD games in the last TIs - og would frequently be on the back foot, semi-losing a game, but they'd come back by picking heroes like spectre who get rather hard to chase and pin down.  That style of play would be a lot harder on the current map.

It definitely makes TP boots a huge value item - they always really have been a very high-value support item, because for a large part of many games, simply having another warm body in a fight matters more than any directly-intervening item pickup (at least until BKBs come online, usually).  But now they matter a lot more for rotations when you're down multiple towers and don't have TP targets at all - at least being able to get to creeps can get you a full third of the map closer, in many cases.

A running trend I've seen in a lot of games is for the enemy to take your ""outpost plateau"", and it really seems like if they do, it's usually a losing play to try to unseat them.  Not sure why, but that high ground up there seems hard to take uphill fights in.  When they do though, it feels good to just start farming their side of the map, and - ideally, force them to divert some attention and not be a 5-pack of killers fishing off the outpost plateau.

Busting up the 5-stack seems to be the way to turn games like that - doing something that forces external attention.

As for space creators, supports that can threaten tower kills and hard-push are pretty good.  Shadow Shaman's a great example, and there's a huge bonus if they're a sort of hero like SShaman or Lion who can earnestly threaten 1v1 kills.  You're not even necessarily looking to fight - you're just trying to poke hard enough to **force** at least 2 of them to head over and slow you down.  These heroes also usually carry blinks, so they can run like hell the moment the TPs come in (warding at a spot that gets vision if any enemies are porting to the outpost is a very high priority).  The ideal thing is to push just hard enough to get them to TP ""for real"" and not just cancel at the last minute.

Then again if they cancel, you just got a free tower.

&#x200B;

Another hero that's great at creating space is techies;  the trick is that you're now pretty fast, and you've got a built-in tool to defend against people chasing you (blue mines), but you've also got a way to quickly clear waves (red mines) and pose a genuine threat to the tower if you're allowed to get that far (red mines).  Furthermore just by being techies and being halfways decent, you can make enemies a little reluctant to chase.

Another great one is probably venomancer with blink and probably cast range bonuses.   You can toss wards up onto places that might be deathtraps, and use them to cover paths towards ganking you as you push.",2020-04-03 09:34:58

I feel lots of people are just buying accounts at divine right now for NA. They're really not expensive. You can get low level divine accounts for $20.

Went 4-4 yesterday, both as 4 wins then 4 losses in a row

6/8 of my wins or losses, if you look at the enemy/your team, they had low level (30-50) players, 5 people on their friends list, with no history or their history has streaks on the usual heroes (lycan, brood, meepo). These players had no idea how to make plays, poor mechanics, and could not make proper decisions.

The 1 win I had that wasn't due to some low level player had south american cores that got stomped in lane by our US/CA cores.

The 1 loss I had that wasn't due to some low level player had a south american support afk jungle and refused to play. His name in spanish was something like ""I don't have any friends, why am I playing"".

I still yell at my comp.. But i am not adding to the toxicity going on.. I just play my best till the end and it usually works out...

Look at my last game and you will see what imean... We werre stomping.... Then someone triggers mid.. And then storm just feeds non stop...... He like eventually stopped... But damn was it stressful when you are a game or two from next rank...


When in doubt... Just dont pile on.. Cause i was cursing in that game... Let me tell ya!

Watch this game.. And feel your brain explode... I reported both rubik and storm on my team ( i was snap)

you are letting your more primitive evolutionary apparatus, i.e: emotions, run lose by \_caving in\_ to the harrassment received from your team; your original motive is to enjoy a game of dota, which is then replaced by self-sabotaging.   
and by the blessings of your community, your family, your upbringing; you have the mental resources to deflect this L into a W by painting you as the hero, \[insert quote about the dubious virtue of self-proclaimed saints here\] even going as far as to say that you do it ""for the community"". Still, you let them change you. You lost yourself. You lost.

Do you see how this behaviour can be damaging in a REAL life situation? 

I had to learn the hard way.

Every game is a chance to learn, and what better place than a mode with no mmr to lose? At least now I know why you don’t really want to have a team with troll, specter, wraith king and AM. I’ll do my support job as I think it should be done and won’t let some random people on the internet make me feel like I’ve wasted 45-60 minutes.

Over time your wins and losses due to abandons are going to all even out, which is why the only person who gets punished is the abandoner (and their party, for that matter, who the game always counts as a loss for in terms of MMR).

If you change this.. this means that everytime someone abandons a game, there would be mmr left on the table meaning in the long run there would be a deficit in mmr meaning rank disparity would become greater.. deflation of a currency - in this case, the currency is mmr.

&#x200B;

My point is: mmr is not unlimited.. that is the reason a rank can be attained.. mmr is a currency and if valve mints more it inflates the currency.. if we trade mmr and some are left out, the opposite of inflation will happen and suddenly the highest mmr might be 8k and the average closer to 2k instead of 3k",2020-04-02 17:25:41

There's a famous 2k mmr player, Young Scientist, he has 15000 games. 

He has a shit ton of ""experience"" but he is still garbage and new players who hover around 2k mmr have the same skill as him. 

In fact their potential is even higher due to the amount of games it took them to be 2k mmr. 

A herald player should know his place and not lord over literal new players. He should be embarrassed he is even being matched with them. 

It's not about number of games or experience but about skill. 

Would you call a divine player with 10000 matches better than me because I have 1200?

Wouldn't it be the other way around, that I did in 1200 games what he did in 10000 therefore I'm better?

3172,fm8xkfx,comment,1585857884.0,1,"So here’s the basic things that I’m seeing:

- You could probably tighten up your drafting pool a bit. Not a huge deal, but often it’s a good idea to pick maybe 2-3 heroes per role and just focus on those.

- I’m not trying to say techies can’t be good (though in my opinion he’s rather “all-in”-y and there are better picks that accomplish similar things), but be aware that playing the hero is probably going to impact your behavior score, which will lead to less coherent teams.

- Literally every support you are playing should be buying a magic stick, and the majority will upgrade to a magic wand. Even a number of cores can benefit from one, though that’s a bit more matchup/draft dependent.

- Some of your ability builds are a little outdated. Stuff like maxing spirit lance rather than phantom rush, for example.

- A few of your item builds are similarly outdated. Some of them still work just as well (for example shadowblade Slark) because you’re playing against lower MMR players, but there may be better options that don’t fall off as you climb.

- Are you attack-moving to cancel your animations properly? I can’t tell this one without watching replays but a lot of players at your level don’t and it’s an easy thing to do. Purge has a [great video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S20bc4Tn6Ck) that covers that and a few other topics.

I think that those are the biggest things that I’m seeing off the cuff. If you’re interested you might like checking out Purge’s Learn Dota series (though a bit of that is a little outdated now), and he’s also doing a crash course thing with a player who probably isn’t too much worse than you that might be really helpful.",2020-04-02 20:04:44
3173,fm96pdk,comment,1585862752.0,1,"You are really misunderstanding.

The reason people suggest to play a few heroes is because that strategy WORKS.  I too, hate spamming the same hero 50 games in a row and do not do it.  But I have narrowed down picking basically whatever hero I felt like down to about 8, the ones that I find wins with and have fun playing.  I dont have to play only ONE hero to climb.  But KheZu said this in a video of his -  look at your last 2 pages of games in the Dota client.  If you have 20 heroes picked, that's too many.  You need to tone it down and focus on the basics of Dota.

Things like last hitting, winning your lanes, knowing your good matchups, knowing your limits with heroes, rotating, creep aggro and lane pulling win you games of Dota.

You are misunderstanding the most important aspect of this game.  People will respect your number for being higher, not the heroes you chose that led you there.  People will respect you for being a good teammate, not for playing or not playing a specific hero.  People will respect you for winning hard games regardless of your hero choice.  People will respect you for being respectful.

Nobody cares what heroes you play.  Spam Techies if it wins you games and you have fun.  And spam means like pick it 20% of your games, not 100.  It's fine to play 5-8 heroes and play them significantly better than to play 50.  Focus on your basics and you'll climb, that's what I have done.",2020-04-02 21:25:52

3175,fm81ohr,comment,1585841111.0,1,"> That's why heroes only seem broken at the pro level, there's no higher rank for them to climb to.

Heroes stay around 50% on pub level, because spammers climb/fall when the hero is buffed/nerfed until they reach 50% equilibrium again. When you feel like you comfortably beat an overbuffed hero or comfortably win with a weak one on your team, that's because you're playing against/with someone whose skillset is +/-300 where it would be otherwise.  To suggest otherwise is ridiculous.  A lot of buffs, especially stat buffs have an exact item equivalence.  People wouldn't buy those items to lane if they didn't improve winrate.

Of course it's most evident at the pro level, because there's rank for them to climb to.

As for techies, it's my go to pick when I'm burnt out, it's always fun to play and that applies to support heroes too, I play them when I need a relaxed game.

Phantom Lancer's note, I thought Q scales well and I don't fight early on so I don't really max out E but it might be a better option in order to farm faster.

Slark's note, I went for it that game because we needed a silver edge and my other teammates didn't want to build it, but we desperately needed to break some passives on the opposite team.

I don't think I'm canceling the animation enough.
Was hoping for a more detailed insight :P, like where am I fucking up, is it the laning stage, fights, objectives... Etc but thank you very very much. I'll check some videos on animation canceling, not going for purge tho, he bores me.

All of the above in small amounts? Some things are a little harder to analyze without actually watching replays which I can’t do on my phone (positioning in fights can’t be seen from a Dotabuff, for example).

In the vast majority of cases (including yours) there’s no silver bullet fix like “oh work on X and you’ll climb 1k MMR”. Rather it’s a matter of fixing little things until together they all add up to the climb you want to see. For example changing your skill builds often improves your entire early game, tightening your draft makes you more consistent, etc.; they all add up to those little advantages that snowball you to winning those handful of extra games you wouldn’t have before, which raises your MMR.

In your case the things I see above are the things I’d point out where fixing them is probably your current best bang for your buck. This doesn’t mean you don’t have other facets that could also be improved but those are the largest ones.

To put it another way, I’m not seeing any big fuck ups on your part (at least without looking at replays), I’m just seeing a bunch of little errors and inconsistencies that as a whole are holding you back.",2020-04-02 22:25:59

Just grind some behaviour score and ALWAYS keep it above 9k, you'll never get to low priority even if you alone ruined the whole game and still manage to win. That's just how the players with high scores are, they tend to look for a solution rather than rage reporting and flaming your whole damn family.

I'll tell you what I did. 

200 turbo matches. Played only support dazzle. Always graved my carry, NEVER used it on myself.

Absolutely ZERO communication unless directly spoken to, and always respond In a positively and encouraging way to babysit my tilting apes. 

After a won game, say ggwp commend team. And swap commends with anyone that commends you first. 

After a lost game, say NOTHING so you don't become the scapegoat for the loss and get rage reported. 

The idea is that a pos 5 dazzle you will fly under the radar and almost never get blamed for a loss. 

Zero flaming, zero suggestions for items, zero pinging items, zero snarky passive aggressive comments. 


Took me about two months. Went from 3000 to 8000. 

Then I played unranked until I hit 9000. Then ranked until 10k. 

If you play core every single game you are more likely to take the blame and get reported regardless of win/lose. 

My strategy works guaranteed. That's how you grind behavior score. Not tryharding in ranked shitty ancient games. That's how you get reported senselessly.",2020-04-02 16:32:40

If you follow all these posts about cheaters in the last 3-4 days, you can see that it's 3-5 same players are using ""alt accounts"" (all got VAC/game bans) to test this cheat and advertise it. They don't care if these accounts gets banned, they will just write ""we need accounts to test our cheat"" in their discord and people will give them. Or they will use botted/hacked accounts too. Their main accounts are already banned 6 months ago when they relased famous crasher. They don't care about bans, they just need money from their cheat. Better cheat = more money...

I saw they got many users in their discord. Daily cheat updates, 24/7 support, many players are helping devs to develop new scripts and cheats. Cheats/accounts market in Russia is huge. I don't think that few bans can do damage here. Need better anti-cheat or just keep fixing these exploits.

Most chip damage heroes can kill him in lane (Mars and Night Stalker), especially around level 3,4, and 5.  You are stronger than him if you do not trade inefficiently with him.

I also play Leshrac in the offlane and literally never lose to Slarks.  You can easily bully him out of lane with your 80 mana stun that you use to fuck up his last hits, you push W and R in a teamfight and he can never isolate you without paying for it with his life, and you dont give a fuck about his ultimate to damage him.

There are tons of strong things against Slark.  Timbersaw (who I dont really play), is awful for Slark, nearly unplayable because you never are going to want to jump on him unless he is entirely alone or his team is entirely dead. 

Slardar, another hero I do not play, crushes Slark in lane.  You bash his fucking skull in at lv 1 and 2 while he cant do shit about it.  You have higher damage, more hp, and more armor.  Unlosable lane.",2020-04-02 20:33:35

~~OD player is the cheater here, he ""ddosed"" jugg and controlled his hero.~~

EDIT: I was wrong, sorry.  OD and jugg are party and they both are cheating, they probably tested this cheat on themselves.Jugg:[http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198244054372](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198244054372)

As you can see from my screenshot I posted, it's taken from their Twitch \[by one of these cheaters\] and jugg has the same profile image there. I made post about these 2, but they ""hacked"" enemies there. Maybe they tested this cheat on themselves lol.

The same OD and jugg cheating in other games(he is streaming with cheats, all videos are removed now):

You also never max your fucking infernal blade as a doom against an anti mage, like it blows my mind how dumb someone has to be to do that, he cant farm against the anti mage nor can he farm creeps now with 1-1-3 build.

If you truly want to get better you need to invest time outside actually just queuing up and playing. (Was hard stuck on ancient 4 - divine 1 for a very long time just going up and down allllll the time)

PS. Don’t focus on everything at once either, slim down your hero pool to a maximum of 3. Play only one position. In 2.4k I would chose POS 1 and focus to developing your lane skills. Don’t focus on niche stuff like choking map at min 15 or something else. Focus on the easiest stuff like getting the last hits/denies, creep pulling and when to trade hits with the enemy off lane. People in archon usually don’t harass the pos 1 in the extent they do in higher brackets.",2020-04-02 10:41:34

4027,fm8zef5,comment,1585858832.0,1,"A method I currently use to improve (I'm divine 3 at the moment) is I watch a pro player replay from dotaprotracker on a hero I want to learn/play. I get a notebook and I write down as much as I can about what they do usually in the first 10-15 minutes. I then queue for that roll, pick that hero, and try to mimick what they did using the notes that I took. When I'm done with the game I rewatch the game I just played and compare things like timings and decisions that I may have made differently.

For example if gH playing pheonix got tranquils at 5 minutes and I didn't get mine until 7 I'd note that and ask why or what I could have done to make my play more like gH. 

&#x200B;

I think a big problem that people have is being TOO fluid with what they are doing in the game. In many cases the reason pro players are so good is because they do the most efficient thing more often than everyone else. In my opinion, until you are like 6k mmr or more, you don't have the dota knowledge necessary to make spur of the moment decisions, and you're better off copying a pro players item builds / skill builds / rotations etc until you've done them enough to know when and why they do them. At which point you wont be 2k anymore.

&#x200B;

Just to make it super clear. Find pro replays. Make note of what they do that you dont. Try and do those things at the same rate they do.",2020-04-02 20:20:32

You can't. You force people to play support and 8 years later, nobody STILL wants to play this role because let's face it, it's not interesting, no matter what people will write here. Statistics just show it.

I played support for the better half of these 8 years and I never truly enjoyed the game, I just played to play with my friends.

I don't know what to tell you other than if you want proof that support is a low-impact role, go find a mate with like 3 ranks higher than you (or whoever you run this experiment on), have the high rank guy pick support and the low rank guy pick core.

4141,fm7b45p,comment,1585820105.0,1,"Well, same goes to enemy team, right? They will find a lack of support too. I do understand those feelings from you though, as I have to relearn to playing core roles (mid, offlaner, carry, etc) with gameleap tutorials during this year.

By the way, I don't played ranked so... don't you guys have a role queue? I know the rumors have said the supports are playing trash, but you shouldn't be stuck with playing supports if you felt got extreme bored or burned out, you should just go for a carry tbh and start doing it.

Another way, if you're really lucky, is getting a good party. I had lots of fun with it, and that was 3 years ago (which I have never forgotten because the game quality was extremely good, and cannot have its difference with any others). Although, getting a GOOD party is very hard though. I can't find a better party these days, some are jerks or just too noobs, its hard to find it.",2020-04-02 09:35:05
4142,fm7loz3,comment,1585830983.0,2,"I've played like 95%+ of my matches on DotA as a support, both solo queue and in stacks/parties.

I like the entire warding 'game' that supports play, dewarding each other, figuring out tendencies, etc.

I enjoy ruining someone's lane/game by either harassing them/killing them constantly with my lane partner, pulling and forcing them to miss out on experience/last hits, trading effectively, or rotating to allow my team to have advantages on the map.

I enjoy outplaying people with defensive items and preventing them from killing my cores, or initiating a fight that, even if it kills me, allows my team to take objectives.

I like min-maxing what gold I have in order to ensure I build the item with the highest impact, and also prefer it when the limited tools I have matter *more*, rather than just having a ton of tools.

Do I need to go on? Support is not a popular role because it's more nuanced and people can blame supports without having any idea about what they're talking about. It's also difficult to play properly because you need to know when to rotate, who to rotate on, who's worth salvaging, etc. Is it the most impactful role that will let you solo carry? No. Do you get to farm all the time? No. You're the one who makes sure that the people farming are safe by effectively warding, ganking, counter-ganking, etc. Most people don't enjoy something that has more tactics/thinking to it and just want to mindlessly hit creeps, get big items, etc; giving supports more gold won't change that because you'll still get the ""support"" Lion going Tranquils>Ags(And likely never finish it before the game ends), which isn't the right way to play in a vast majority of cases.",2020-04-02 12:36:23
4143,fm9vp61,comment,1585877633.0,1,"My question has nothing to do with enjoyment of particular role, it’s about having impact when playing support.",2020-04-03 01:33:53
4144,fm7avh0,comment,1585819828.0,2,"Your still misunderstanding what i say, support are not for winning the game solo by right clicking enemys one by one, they make space for it, ofc the game wont be won if 4k player plays pos5 and 1k player goes pos1, even if supports make lot of space, if carry use this time badly he wont get any benifit from it, but will game be won if 4k player goes pos1 and 1k player plays support? Let me tell you how i think it can look like, pos1 wont have solo exp at all, supp will sit next to him in lane doing nothing probably not even trying to zone offlaner and will deny 1 creep every 10 minutes at best, you wont have any camps stacked and he will rarely pool, he will run around and maybe get kill or two early game, but in mid game he will probably overcommit over and over and die over and over, making no space for you to farm, and your mmr will mean nothing here as even if you are 4k mmr and play vs 2k mmr, if enemy cores had space to farm, made by their supports, and they used this time wisely and get their items and will have like 3 items, when your sitting at 1, they will just kill you, no matter what. So using this reasoning both support and cores need to have idea about game to win, you cant say support have 0 impact if your losing, as core players can say same thing, ""core roles have 0 impact as they cant win early by themselves"" they need supports to make space, while supports need cores to use this space and time to get gold, and carry them in later stages of the game

Maybe not WITH omnislash, for that matter.

It's funny and amusing to see the jugg tilt and keep chasing long after it makes sense, but a spin-tp back to base at that 18-second mark, or a turn-about to try to join the fight, just ends with a dead jugg and 10 extra seconds before the ancient falls.

4267,fm7d7bm,comment,1585822493.0,203,"It was a summer day like any other when the Juggernaut claimed he saw the dragon.

""Don't be silly,"" his family said, ""dragons don't exist. You didn't see anything. It was just your imagination.""

The Juggernaut ignored their claims. He knew what he saw. Nobody else could shake his beliefs.

""Listen to your family,"" the clan had told him, ""don't go chasing drreams.""

But he knew it wasn't a dream. The dragon was real, in front of his very eyes, just asking to be slain as a trophy.

The Juggernaut acted with conviction. Once he set his mind to something, it was impossible to convince him to back down. Though his friends pleaded and begged, they couldn't stop him from setting out on his journey, away from his village, away from the only place he had ever known, to find the dragon he was so sure he saw.

Days went by, then weeks. Deeper and deeper into the woods he went, his mood worsening with each passing moment. A dragon was lurking here, he knew it! It just wouldn't reveal itself to him.

That night, the Juggernaut had a strange dream. He heard the voices of his people wishing he would come home. The sounds of his village resonated in his ears: the blacksmith's hammer against the anvil, the liveliness of the local tavern, and perhaps loudest of all, his family, saying a prayer each night hoping for his swift return.

The Juggernaut sat up, awoken from his slumber, and staring him in the face was the dragon. He blinked, and the beast was gone. A moment of stillness. Then, filled with great vengeance and furious anger, he jumped to his feet and retrieved his sword. Yelling with the burning passion of his ancestors before him, he charged forward, out of his tent, deeper into the woods, deeper, deeper into the heart of darkness itself. There, he would find it. There, he would know. There, he would finally slay the accursed beast and be at peace from this madness, nay, this insanity plaguing his mind for so long.

Unfortunately his ancient exploded shortly after and he lost 30 MMR.",2020-04-02 10:14:53

They don’t realize that if they keep playing with the same calm and collected attitude (even if their toxic teammates are flaming them), they have a much higher chance of actually winning and feeling better about themselves. 

This doesn’t just include the high legend players though. I had an immortal Russian Huskar on my team throw when we were crushing the game.

I fall asleep at night dreaming of her holding a personal concert for me, and then she would be sorry tired that she comes and cuddles up to me while we sleep together. If I could just hold her hand for a brief moment, I could die happy. If given the opportunity, I would lightly nibble on her ear just to hear what kind of sweet moans she would let out. Then, I would hug her while she clings to my body hoping that I would stop, but I only continue as she moans louder and louder.

I would give up almost anything just for her to look in my general direction. No matter what I do, I am constantly thinking of her. When I wake up, Dark Willow is the first thing on my mind. When I go to school, I can only focus on her. When I go come home, I go on the computer so that I can listen to her beautiful voice. When I go to sleep, I dream of her and living a happy life together. Dark Willow is my pride, passion, and joy.

I wish for nothing but her happiness. If it were for Dark Willow, I would give my life without any second thoughts. Without her, my life would serve no purpose. I really love Dark Willow.

4369,fmadvfz,comment,1585890979.0,1,"Yeah it can work. In my 20 games I had a Riki that went for boots and straight tried to rush nullfier, a mid Luna that wondered why we won every single lane but lost the game, a juggernaut that went for Armlet first item into aghs, an eartshaker that maxed his second skill even though he was roaming and a pudge that went hook lvl1 and bought a 15 min urn when ns had already a vessel and a spectre that last picked his hero knowing the offlane was gonna be necro rubick when I had picked grimstroke - we won all other lanes and then we lost the game because he used his haunt around 0.5 seconds before he died with aegis. 

That's nowhere near 4.5k, hell that's not even 3.5k.

A 6 slotted jugg can definitely fight a 6 slotted AM, but the AM will kill your team a lot better than you will kill theirs on jugg. On top of that, you’re more likely gonna be a two slotted jugg (bfury and then your next item) vs a three or four slotted AM, considering farming speeds and timings.

4373,fmd2mwq,comment,1585957963.0,1,"6 slotted Jugg has higher damage output than 6 slotted AM by a pretty wide margin. But the main issue against AM is dealing with the split push and the creep cutting. BF enables you to keep lanes pushed out so you can take towers and contain AM in his jungle. When the team limits AM's space, he ends up having nothing safe to farm at times, keeping him from pulling away from Jugg in farm. If you instead go something like Diffusal, you absolutely have to get multiple kills on AM or you lose. I think it could work if your mid can take towers quickly, but BF is generally the safer play.

The guardians think they're hot shits who deserve atleast 3k MMR. Thus they're overly toxic, much too vocal about their teammates' item choices, and of course, want to first pick Invoker mid.

The Ancients and low Divines are wannabe immortal top 100. They think they have the potential to be the next rtz.

However, just to clarify it can't be purged off 'by any dispel'. Like all stuns it can only be dispelled by strong dispel. And with strong dispel there are only 13 sources in the entire game of dota, 11 are from heroes and only 4 of those are castable on other heroes from the getgo, with another 3 being able to be cast on other heroes either via aghs or level 25 talents. 

Only 2 items exist that give strong dispel, both being situational and both requiring a certain condition to met outside of your control. 

So yes it can be dispelled by a strong dispel but those are few and far between in dota.",2020-04-03 01:22:26

4847,fmar42n,comment,1585904479.0,2,"hey.

dirty trick.

the damage amp works on *radiance*.

and it's 12% **per axe**, not 12% per cast.  There are two per cast, and the ""effective"" cooldown is something like 1-2s.

there's also no stack limit, and the stacks aren't independent, so as long as you hit them *at all* during a 12s window, the stacks keep adding up.

&#x200B;

So yeah, you can do some dirty, dirty meme builds with this.

I feel like this is probably best used against lineups where everyone's rolling big beefy strength heroes (ogre, underlord, kunkka, etc), and they're counting on just raw tankiness to roll through fights.   This would probably be trash against things like Ursa.  Needs to be slow-damage ""sustain"" opponents.

>imo something that would make it worth getting but not overly OP would be something that either buffs the hp/dmg/slow of the boar

That's actually what his aghs does.  12% per stack for ""all damage coming from all units controlled by him"".  Boars are included.  4 axe casts and the boars are doing double damage.",2020-04-03 09:01:19

4931,fm7gcme,comment,1585825984.0,1,"Personally I got really sick of Dota. There was a period where I would play it every day and spend entire weekends playing it, and would spend almost all my free time playing or thinking about it, and also, a portion of my non free time. 

After stopping for a year or two, I find that now I can stomach a turbo game maybe once a week or so and that's it.

The problem with Dota is that unless you're really into it, playing a normal game feels like a chore. Especially if you're trying to unwind. I used to be acutely aware of everything that was going on on the map, always looking for people to gank with relocate. Now I sometimes go check if Rosh is up only to realize my teammate killed it five minutes prior. Halfway through games I mentally check out because I wish I were playing another game.

I've reached a point where I just play Techies. I don't need to be all that aware of what's happening to stack green mines on lanes and press a button when someone walks over them.

I think it's because the game has gotten too complicated for me. Too many runes/outpost/tome/ward cooldowns to keep track of. I wish I could go back to 6.75 Dota and just fuck around like an idiot.",2020-04-02 11:13:04

4962,fm7n9rn,comment,1585832217.0,1,"Positioning, positioning, positioning. Watch replays of pro games and pay attention to supports. In particular how they use trees and fog in the laning stage to harass the enemy without taking as much damage themselves. Those extra few hits you get off without being hit yourself will add up in the long run!

In teamfights as a squishy support you can get bursted easily so again take advantage of trees and fog to survive longer and get your key spells off. Carries don’t wanna spend 10 seconds chasing a jakiro.

If you’re a core player, think more about when you’re strong and should fight vs when you’re weak and should farm. E.g. in general, AM is weak levels 1-2 so play passive. But with the right support he can be a real threat to most offlaners between levels 3-5 just because of mana break, so be aggressive even if you have no items.",2020-04-02 12:56:57

There are quite a few professional occupations that are way more stressful on a daily basis compared to playing a game in the comfort of your home (and without the added pressure of it being a competitive tournament), and I certainly have not seen most adults lose it like that in situations much more serious than another player making a mistake.

To be fair, I wouldn't condemn anyone for his emotions and in fact I sympathize with him, it mostly irritates me when on some of these occasions he starts insulting his entire audience during his frustration and attempting to justify both of these behaviors in the process.

In any case, he seems to be a good guy and without a doubt an outstanding streamer, and when he calms down he always seems to regret his overreactions (like we all human beings do), so just hope that he doesn't take honest mistakes in the game to heart as it is simply not worth it.

Needless to say, raging a bit from time to time is not a big deal either and people hating on someone for showing his emotional reactions while being exposed to a live audience during the larger part of his day aren't a better example.",2020-04-02 08:53:00

Sometimes he'd stop playing for a couple of hours or even take the rest of the day off. 

Dota can be a very triggering game and I think it's sad that Gorgc feels like he should keep playing the game at times when he should just stop. Streaming Dota as a career sounds like such a shit deal honestly, it's one of the worst games to have to stream for hours non-stop to make a living imo. I think ever since Valve removed party MMR, Bulldog started playing with the megacucks and I feel like you never see him rage like this anymore. I never watch his stream myself but I'm glad he found a way to enjoy streaming and playing Dota. As someone who behaves the same way as Gorgc does when I play Dota, I wish him all the best and hope he finds a better way to deal with this kinda rage. Sure, he hurt nobody by smashing his mouse or keyboard but that shit takes a mental toll.",2020-04-02 13:38:42

5211,fm7ibxz,comment,1585828010.0,3,"had a similar idea a while back, but i intended it for coaches to use it on an ipad during games to keep track, because keeping track during gameplay seemed tedious and inefficient.

you noticed it yourself, there are too many variables to maintain during gameplay to make it exact.

\- which level of the spell

\- cd recution talents

\- cd reduction items

there is usually no way to keep track of this while playing at the same time. after they banned coaches during matches i gave up on the concept.",2020-04-02 11:46:50

5218,fm7q9dt,comment,1585834365.0,1,"5 years ago I came up with the same idea (sort of), but more integrated into DotA 2. You could use a hotkey programmable in the game to send a text message to your team posting the remaining rosh respawn time. If you're curious, this is what remains of it, I believe the core idea should still work if you import proper packages, the details like timer changes would need an update though:

 [https://github.com/fatcuntroller/DotaRoshTimer](https://github.com/fatcuntroller/DotaRoshTimer)

I'm linking u this to make u realize how little use and interest it got, despite people saying this is in 'near hax' territory on dota dev forums.

I cannot imagine having an app with inferior controls (unless I'm wrong about what ur trying to accomplish) be more succesful. The way I understand is that you take your hands off the keyboard to press a button in a mobile app?

5219,fm6j8so,comment,1585795316.0,1,"never shown this before. i just started working on this a few days ago. 

&#x200B;

there is a page where you select the skills you are interested in. i thought about just only defaulting to showing 60s or more (usually ults. but not always). but thought, why not give them the ability to pick and choose... i dont know. maybe thats dumb.

&#x200B;

ok so maybe just 1 screen. shows all the heros and their longest cooldown skill. then you can click on the hero and manipulate things like Inventory and Talents.

&#x200B;

How do i let the user tell the app the level of the skill? i could do some gestures. but i kind worry that gestures will be more tedious/difficult to use quickly in the game.

&#x200B;

i am trying to keep separate things that change once, and then never change back (like gaining an item like aghs, or a talent selection) and things that apply one time. like ""chrono cast his ult. but he had arcane rune \*this time\* so adjust the cooldown of this one spell cast but onty this one"". vs ""chrono has octarine. make sure you adjust the cooldown of all spell casts from now on""

&#x200B;

At the start of the app, you select the heros on the other team. Then you select which of their skills you want to ""track"". Then the main screen is just the heros and the skills you are tracking. 

&#x200B;

The screen i showed in the post is one of the configuration windows. So you can say ""Oh This hero picked up an octarine, he is leveled up, and he has these talents"" so the tracker will be accurate.  that UI might be a little clunky. so it can be imrpoved if a designer has some ideas for me.",2020-04-01 23:32:09

For levels I think gestures would be fine. Swipe left/right to change levels. Also double tap to cancel/reset the timer.

If you really want to include all spells, I guess you could but main thing is to have sane defaults so the config is optional. I don’t think it’s necessary though, I’m trying to think of heroes with more than 1 spell to track... Chen recall and ult?

Arcane rune you could make it auto turn off after 50s (regardless of when it was turned on). I don’t think there is any source of temporary Aghs in the game now? Other than manually dropping Aghs but that’s so rare it shouldn’t matter.",2020-04-02 03:05:33

The fact that you omitted the draft, builds and replay link isn't a good sign.  


I mean, it sounds like he went WK position 1, which is ultra punished by so many heroes. What's a WK gonna do against a Bristleback? Or a Faceless Void? Or a strong split push?

5341,fm8w1zf,comment,1585857091.0,1,"Puck is in a weird spot right now, but he's still super fun to play. I definitely no longer recommend the right click build even if I loved going Bloodthorn + Nullifier back in the day since they butchered his damage talent as well as starting lane damage.

What I find myself doing most games is a very simple build nowadays, and it's 2 nulls and treads into dagger and just try to make as much space in the mid game as possible. After that almost always either Euls or Aghs. If you are doing a lot of fights and have kill potential, go Aghs as it's useful even when opponents don't have spell immunity. If not, Euls and just split farm the hell out of all lanes as you are basically unkillable with it if they have no hex or other instant disables. Late game almost always Hex, but you can also opt for Dagon if you are doing super well, or refresher if you need that BKB carry completely screwed. I personally like Octarine as well for funzies.

From there, it's striking the balance between map presence and flash farming the entire part of the map otherwise inaccessible to your hard carry, and being always either in TP range or Orb+blink range to help out in fights. If this portion goes well, you either win already or transition into late where they can't even win anymore cause Level 25 talent is ridiculous and perma silences the supports in the back line.

The downside is, if midgame goes poorly, you will have a very bad time, and making a good mid game with Puck takes much more game sense that comes from a lot of games rather than a specific build (since his build is now simple anyway). Still, I tend to have fun either way, just make sure to not pick him into TA or Lion.

Of Neutral items my favorites are Nether Shawl, Quickening Charm, Spell Prism. Fun fact, Spell prism + Octarine makes your Waning rift have 2.4 sec CD, and phase shift 3.6",2020-04-02 19:51:31
5342,fm8weyg,comment,1585857285.0,1,thanks for the response! ill definately give it a go for a few games. what skill build in lane do you recommend?,2020-04-02 19:54:45
5343,fm8ykb9,comment,1585858403.0,1,"Since they butchered his starting damage I start with mantle x2 circlet x2 if you don't expect a lot of lane harras the tango or 2 you get from your support is usually enough. Otherwise if it's some brainless idiot like MK or TA, one circlet less in favor of more tangoes and a salve when bounties are picked up. Finish up Nulls before boots since you can control the runes with the Orb without movespeed.

As for the skill build I mostly max Orb then rift, with a value point in Phase shift mostly on level 2 to disjoint projectiles, but sometimes I Go Orb, Rift, Orb and get phase shift on lvl 4 instead if I can see that the damage potential can score me an early kill.

The Orb is better for maxing most of the time as the CD and range is superior, but if the mid laner can severly punish you if you don't have Orb for escape, or if you need the longer silence for Storm or QoP, then max the Rift instead.

I always skill the cast range talent as the cast range for Rift, dagger and ult is invaluable for your initiation range, as well as items later such as Dagon Euls or Hex. I mostly get it right on level 10, but if I get an early dagger I skip both the talent and ultimate in favor of maxing out Phase Shift as soon as possible to be able to reliably get blink out of shift earlier and play more aggressively. Also, -9 sec waning rift is simply a must, no contest since the level 25 talent massively improves the spell.",2020-04-02 20:13:23

1 item slot, stun goes through bkb, stun last 2 seconds, channel time is 1.7 seconds. Abyssal makes you tanky, gives a bit of damage, and still has a chance to proc stun even on range. 

The cost of blink/euls is 4k+ and the cost of abyssal is 6k+ but only uses one item slot and has the added utility of the stun. 

Pair all that with the 40% CD reduction at 25 and you have a 17 second stun/blink that goes through bkb

abyssal on a ranged hero is extremely luxury in most cases, but with this combo it could be arguable. It competes with other items though like butterfly, scythe, MKB. Mostly I think it can be an alternative to scythe.

Early/mid game though blink+euls is still much better since the buildup is much faster and provides a lot of other benefits like being able to spam spells, and massive mobility in general.

5626,fm55saz,comment,1585766847.0,5,"> Kotl, why the HELL are you splitpushing. If anyone should be it's AM.

I feel like this is so wrong. Kotl can easily push creeps into the tower, can heal them (if he has aghs during the day or has items like meka) and with pushed creeps his team can join to deal damage to the tower.

Whereas AM is much useful in a more risky push (highground, for example) and surely does more damage to the tower than a kotl pushing waves in.

Surely it's situational. But from what you have described I would rather be mad at AM not pushing the hg with the team rather than kotl going away if it's safe to push.",2020-04-01 18:47:27
5627,fm569t6,comment,1585767104.0,2,"You have to think of it in terms of what a hero can accomplish in a push. If their presence is enough to safeguard/babysit your tower hitters to the point you can substantially siege a tower's HP or get barracks, then by all means they should come. If they don't really have much of a presence or deal like no damage to towers (KotL for instance), then they can go do other stuff like ward, push out other lanes, take outposts, runes, or just grab more farm. 

There are times where I don't join in on the high ground push simply because I know I won't have any impact on that push. Their remaining heroes can't do anything. We're not going to secure the game with an all-in and it's a likely ""back after rax"". Or other times I'm low hp/mp so I have no use anyways being there. My 20 damage per right click is probably going to amount to like 150 damage total? All the while, I could have done something more meaningful on the map.

My description seems to be even more accurate now if ""the only high ground defense they have is kunkka"" is what you had after a fight during the push.

She also has a number of +damage, cleave, or other talents that amplify the previously mentioned skills. All of this synergizes amazingly well with her ultimate.

Wraith King has exactly none of these things, beyond a single +20 AS talent and a single target stun that works far better if you’re already on top of the target.

For WK this little AS and the glove of haste is more than enough for him for most time at early/mid game, WK is OP this patch and is getting picked a lot in high ranked game because he is right now the most all-around hero in the game and unlike PA  strong on lane, good at pushing and sieging, good at recovering in a lost lane as he is one of the fatest farmer in the game right now, very strong in teamfights as you cannot just ignore him because he have radiance and deals a lot of damage if left him alone because his crits and he is one of the most annoying heroes to kill in the game because of his ult and gets more annoying if he gets his 25 or aghs

* \-If i have 0 armor I'll have 0% resistance and die in **10 hit.**
* \-If I had 16 armor I'll have 50% resistance and die in **20 hits**

* \-""WOW! The first 16 armor gave me 50% resistance that's crazy! I'm taking half damage now!!.
* \-""WHAT?! 18% resistance for the second 16 armor? That's shit!""

* Reducing target's armor from -10 to -15 also makes less difference than from 5 to 0.

* Corrosive gaze effectiveness on a pudge is much more noticable than on an enchantress.

* Armor items are extra valuable as a carry vs natural order aura

5772,fm6n09u,comment,1585797892.0,1,"In general:

Minus armour counters low armour squishies (which is why TA likes to take out supports first)

If they have high armour, you want to use spell damage, unless their HP is also high. Then the best way to deal damage is through sustained damage (autoattacks or spammable spells over 5-10 seconds, note to do this you need to disable them to keep them in place) or just ignore them.

Sustained damage is countered by sustained healing like dazzle and juke items like glimmer and force. To counter this you need burst damage, which is what minus armour strat is. 

All general advice obviously, play according to circumstances",2020-04-02 03:24:52

Of course minus armor is the best when it gets you below 0, and getting you from 5 to -5 is a lot stronger than getting you from 15 to 5, but once negative armor is no longer a option minus armor is more effective the higher armor the enemy has.

We can also flip it around. Say you're the attacker, and you want to increase your DPS by 50%. To keep things simple, compare only armor reduction and flat damage.

* Against any armor value, you can just buy +5 damage.

* Against 0 armor: They take 100% of our damage. We want to change that to 150%, which is achieved at -16 armor. We need to buy **16 armor reduction**.
* Against 16 armor: They take 50% of our damage. We want to change that to 75%, which is achieved at 5.6 armor. We need to buy **10.4 armor reduction**.
* Against 32 armor: They take 31.6% of our damage. We want to change that to 47.4%, which is achieved at 17.6 armor. We need to buy **14.4 armor reduction**.

You said to achieve +50% DPS, you need different armor reduction against different armor.. sure.
Or in other words, if we only talk about positive armors, the more armor the target has, the less ""efficient"" same armor reduction gets.

..But if you have different base damage, the exact same thing happens.

* If your damage is 10, you need +5 to increase it to 150%.
* If your damage is 100, you need +50 to increase it to 150%.

But no one says damage becomes ""less efficient"", or $1 becomes less valuable when you own $1000 compared to when you own $100.

See the problem? Using +x PERCENT as the metric is simply a ""wrong"" way to evaluate it. Or should I say, it is a way, but a flat value change becomes less efficient in percentage, if the base is higher? *no shit!*",2020-04-02 07:09:33

Reason why is in what BSJ mentioned. Armour reduction is most effective when the target is close to 0. So reducing say a 30 armor target to near zero or less by stacking slar, venge and medallion would work because you have committed to being them to near 0. If it was say slar on his own, then it is ineffective.

But then this is inefficient. If the enemy lineup was say 4 squishy heroes + 1 high armour say TB or morph, then you can do this. But you have committed two heroes and items to deal with just one hero. There is a hero that exists for this purpose.

Haha yep it would be your pubs. At high levels, you won't catch any manta or euls building carry that easily. There's a reason phrases like ""Arteezy Manta dodge"" exists. At low levels, people jump in with their AMs, TBs and whatnots and pop manta and go. At higher levels unless the carry is straight abysalling you and thus pops manta to burst you, manta and euls are kept for ""dodges"". So we may have been speaking from different brackets.

Yes at your lower levelled pubs, TB would pop manta early and you are smart to wait around for it.

But imagine you got into a higher bracket and met people thinking the same way. If you were playing TB, would you pop your manta early knowing drow was waiting for it? Exactly. Same way if you were playing drow, you'd be waiting a long arsed time for him to manta early. The only way you'd have hope is you have other teammates that have abilities he needs to manta off.

5848,fm6lm99,comment,1585796919.0,4,"When I say 'relevant stat', it's to the assertion that -armor makes less difference to the amount of physical damage it takes to kill an enemy at higher amounts of armor than it does at lower amounts, irrespective of other factors (e.g. the flat damage from desolator. Pretend you're valuing, say, Presence of the Dark Lord in ability draft.)

 In a game situation when you're choosing items, yes I agree, you are thinking about more things than that -- that's why I talked about optimizing the multiplication of damage * attack speed * crit * -armor (and I didn't mention it, but yes maelstrom/MKB procs as well). Desolator pick adds to -armor and damage, crystalis adds to damage and crit. The -armor factor in that changes in value depending on how much armor the enemy has, and its value increases as armor does; the math in the table you've made is dependent on the damage you have to begin with, whether your character already has a crit or add'l sources of flat damage, and then the overall damage output is also going to depend on your attack speed.

But purely looking at -armor:
> EHP percentage = 100/(1 - ((0.052 × armor) ÷ (0.9 + 0.048 × |armor|)))

A 30 armor hero has effectively 300% of their health against physical damage, while a 24 armor hero has effectively 255% of their health. A 1000 HP target goes from 3000 EHP -> 2550 EHP, so you need to output 450 less damage pre-reduction with -6 armor.

 A 5 armor hero has effectively 130% of their health, while a -1 armor hero has 95% -- so from 1300 effective health to 950, the total damage you need to deal pre-reduction goes down by only 350.

The point that I'm trying to make is that -armor as a statistic increases in value when armor goes up, it doesn't decrease.",2020-04-02 03:08:39

5856,fm6w7oq,comment,1585805058.0,1,"How can you compare things without using percentage. If company A has 3000 revenue and 450 net income and company B with 1300 revenue and 350 net income, that’s like saying company A is better at cost management since it has 100 more net income.

From your numbers let’s say a hero has 100 attack damage pre reduction and attacks 1 time per second. The first dude would take 30 seconds to die, the second dude 13 seconds.

If you buy AS items and you now attack 1.37 times a second, the first dude dies in 21.9seconds, the second dude in 9.5 seconds.

If you buy attack damage item and your attack damage is now 137, the first dude dies in 21.9 seconds, the second dude in 9.5 seconds.

If your attack now apply -6 armor, the first dude dies in 25.5 seconds, the second dude dies in 9.5 seconds.

If we take it your way and say it’s value is still statistically increased as the armor goes higher, it takes 4.5 less second for the first dude to die compare to 3.5 seconds of the second dude, well then it’s true but it’s obviously less effective than other offensive stats which does care about how much armor a hero have.

Yes, I agree (which I stated multiple times), the point I'm making isn't ""build a deso if they have 30 armor"" because that's an abjectly stupid idea except for contrived circumstances. 

The point I'm making is that you /shouldn't/ make the decision to build a deso for the most damage based on the fact that they have low armor; it's actually not more effective when their armor is lower, you should do it because:

* You have large amounts of physical damage that doesn't benefit from crit or attack speed (e.g. Clinkz)
* You have crit/attack speed already and the base damage + additional multiplier from -armor is valuable (e.g. PA)
* Reasons other than dealing damage to heroes with your model (e.g. dealing damage to towers)",2020-04-02 07:17:28

Glimmer cape is more than enough in many cases (unless you are fighting into enemy vision - high ground sentries/obs, which is often game losing anyway).

The trick to finding good CM ults is using her ult as a counter-initiation tool.  If they are trying to take a fight by your tower, get some cover in trees and let it fly.  If they are over-chasing after they start to win a fight against your squad, get into the trees and pop that shit.

Basically, if you have “drawn attention” and they are focusing on you before you have gotten 2-3 second of channeling your ult off, you were probably out of position.  CM ult isn’t an initiation tool or some kind of showstopper carry damage ult (in normal games anyway).

CM one isn’t bad either. Jakiro is ok but not as stellar as the others. 

Phoenix ult can be super hard to deal with when playing against a good Phoenix. You usually want to do it from a different angle than your team is to somewhat block off their escape, but also not far enough from your team that the enemy can easily collapse on it. 

WW is self explanatory. Use on anyone near the carry, or use it ON a core to set up for stuns (or just use it during an enemy cores BKB to run it out. 

Snapfire does fucking stupid damage when pushing high ground, but usually requires some other heroes to synergize with (earthshaker, void, elder titan). Alone it doesn’t scale as well though. 


CM is very much the same, but if you position well in the tree line during a fight ends up causing a LOT of damage and slowing the AS/MS of multiple enemies for a few seconds while also forcing a retreat.

6026,fm4p915,comment,1585758297.0,3,"1: Look at matchup winrates on dotabuff or download the overwolf dotaplus app

2: Yes, items are usually very hero specific. I suggest you follow guides in-game such as those by torte de line or dota plus (if you have that). Eventually, you will get the feel for how items complement different heroes, either by providing what they lack (f ex. health or armor on squishy heroes) or by emphasising what they already have (damage, durability, burst).

3 & 5: A lot of heroes have overlaps but if you want to be good at a hero you have to play it over and over again into both bad and good matchups. The best tip i can give you is focus on 2 roles and 3 heroes for each role. When you know the heroes so well that you dont need to think about how to play them, you can start focusing on overall tactics and decision making.

4: Kills are cool but if you are playing support you shouldnt steal kills, because ur cores are gonna get less money. If you really wanna get a lot of kills, play Axe and killsteal with his ult :)

6: Practice makes perfect. Also watch purge's videos on youtube like biologicalsequins mentioned.

7: Doesnt matter if they are meelee or ranged. If you want to know the best hero for pubs, look at winrates on dotabuff.

8: There are a lot of heroes in dota, you should find some you like. In my opinion some fun, beginner-friendly heroes are: Axe, razor, snapfire, nyx and dazzle.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps and have fun :)",2020-04-01 16:24:57

You win a game, Dota thinks you are too good for your teammates. Next game the teammates are lower skilled. You win again, and the process repeats. After 2-3 victories (sometimes even after 1) the game gives you an impossible match, no matter how good you are and how good your team coordination is, you will lose. A lot of people know if they will win or lose their next game just by looking at their game history. You had a lot of wins recently ? Time for an impossible match.

And this is why it's so frustrating, I think they haven't got the formula right yet. It's good in theory, but that damn unwinnable game makes you want to delete Dota. Like how can it be fun to know that whatever you will do you will lose that game ?

Cores on my level are obsessed with being six slotted and will drag out games and unknowingly allow the enemy team of 4 carrys back into the game and lose it. Rant over I guess",2020-04-01 16:18:05

And then there are the times that you give your safelane carry the easiest lane ever, and they proceed to itemize with terrible items, which then means all that advantage goes poof. I think part of that problem is people just find a build and blindly follow it, instead of seeing what is happening in the game an adjusting on the fly. But again, it goes back to people just not actually understanding the game they are playing.

I've had this working theory that mmr is an indicator to ones intelligence. I'm not exactly sure how ""intelligence"" is defined, but it has a lot to do with emotional control and logistical foresight.   


It takes a lot of foresight to know that you shouldn't use your stun on the Razor that is running towards you, but to instead wait for the Witch Doctor that you KNOW is right behind that bush because there is no way razor would be doing this unless he had a surprise stun to aide him, and you know that the surprise stun is what will secure razor a double kill, so you allow razor to damage and kill you, knowing that once the WD is stunned by you, it will allow your lane partner to trade kills instead of using your stun on the razor and allowing razor to get a double kill.  


that stuff does come with practice, yes, but there are also thousands of players who repeatedly make the same mistakes believing that they were indeed the right decisions, and never get any better.",2020-04-01 17:28:11

Yes, i wasnt born yesterday, i realize that the beginning phase of the game enables your cores do farm and eventually win the game.

I also play p4/5, the amount of skill required at that position to influence a game the way a core player can is massive.

She's has great kill potential at lvl6 if the enemy mid isn't ready for it.

She's good at picking off heroes, even big and beefy or quick and escapey.

She's awful in a teamfight.

If she can land a good shackle it's great. If there is only one target that is a priority in a fight, she is great. If there are multiple heroes that all need to die... lol.

If she's pushing either she commits to pushing or does shit to the buildings and commits to killing an enemy hero.

She needs the right line up to do well, and is one of the safe mids that exist right now. She needs a 3 and 4 that are big and beefy and want to run in and be in front. She needs a 1 that has his items and can kill whatever core she doesn't target and hit buildings. And then a 5 that... doesn't feed. Because she is terrible if she's behind.

6392,fm4uav9,comment,1585760940.0,2,"If you are offlaner in such games, my suggestion is that you pick Pitlord. For me that's the absolute best offlaner if you sense that your teammates don't get the concept of roles or teamplay. Here's why :

1. You can manage your lane, even when your position 4 is useless. You just need a little bit of regen and you are good to go. You are pretty tanky, almost impossible to miss last hits/denies and you can clear waves and stacks pretty fast.
2. If you know what you're doing you are basically 3 roles in one.  
 You are offlaner who can soak tons of damage and doesn't need many items to survive or deal damage. You are good at splitpushing and can be pretty good at kiting the enemy carry with your W + Rod of Atos.  
 You are also supporting the shit out of your team with your auras and ulti. Greaves, Pipe, Crimson, Vlads, Shiva, and Assault are your best friends when your team is Pepega. Buy like 3 of those( depending on the situation ) and just smoke with your team every time you buy one. Lead them into a fight, tank the damage and buff them to make sure they survive. And here comes the best part. When your team is Pepega squad on a suicide mission and you see that they are overextending, you just have to press R twice and run at them. Most support heroes can save 1 hero at a time. You are an offlaner who can save the entire team and prevent a potential teamwipe with ease.  
 You can also hit as hard as a carry and you don't need many items for that. Just show up to fights and push waves and you you will have a pretty good amount of damage from your passive, even by having only defensive items. My ""standard"" Pitlord build would be Greaves > Pipe > Atos > Assault > BM > Heart with some tweaks , but there are situations which are an exception. If late game is approaching and you are doing good, but your carry is struggling hard, you can carry him instead. Buy Assault and ( depending on situation ) Satanic/Abyssal/Desolator/Daedalus. After a successful fight with some of these items you will easily be dealing over 300 damage a hit. Make sure to get the attack speed talent and enjoy slicing through the enemy's buildings.
3. You can first pick Pitlord with no worries.
4. You are very versatile and can buy almost any item. Your team needs disable? You can buy Atos or Hex. Your team needs initiatior? You can buy Blink and use it with your W. Your team has a range carry, but you really need a stun through BKB? You can be the Abyssal hero. Your enemies have too strong teamfight and you have to dodge fights and splitpush? You can go for Necro + BoT + AC and rat like a champ. The list goes on, but I'll stop here for the sake of readability.
5. Top 3 in terms of win rate - 55% currently.

Got carried away a little, but Pitlord is really a great hero. Hope my rambling benefits you in the mmr grind.",2020-04-01 17:09:00

Real talk, though, the most positive matches I've had were when teammates go back and forth with voice lines because it makes them that much funnier. Even when bad things happen and you use a voice line sarcastically, following it up with your hero's laugh line, then they laugh line, can just make a chuckle out of a shitty situation. This attitude typically snowballs throughout the game and people are just fucking around with voicelines.   
Actually, even using chat wheel for comm over voice lines gets less heat from teammates. Turns out people are more receptive to simple text over hearing somebody's voice.",2020-04-01 18:48:04

Shaker has multiple ways to win and several very different builds to choose from. And yes, a core shaker is far more survivable than meepo for the sole reason that he has a way out of fights and just more hp and is far easier to execute. Shaker absolutely dictates the game when hes against meepo cause meepo has to change the way he can play, which is dictating the game by definition; which is also why it is defined as a counter to him.",2020-04-02 02:12:28
6582,fm86q99,comment,1585843844.0,1,"They are totally separate.

Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype (observable characteristics or traits of an organism). Creature that have better trait to adapt to it's environment have better chance to survive and passing on it's gene and have better chance to flourished while those that less able to adapt have lesser chance to do so.

Mutation is alteration in the genome of an organism. Those alteration can happened due to faulty gene duplication process or due to damage to gene because of environment and those changes are random and have unpredictable effect.

Both of those things are different and also does not go hand in hand.

Mutation does not always lead to natural selection because:

1. Cells have gene repair mechanism so even though it's gene are damaged and undergo mutations, they can repair some of those mutations.
2. Many genetic changes due to mutations actually have no impact in gene expression so those mutations does not really matter.
3. Some mutations can occur in some part of a creature body during it's lifetime and not hereditary so it cannot lead to natural selection. For example skin cancer you got from UV radiation.

[https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/05/your-body-acquires-trillions-of-new-mutations-every-day/559472/](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/05/your-body-acquires-trillions-of-new-mutations-every-day/559472/)

Natural selection also does not always require mutation. Environment can change and makes the same creatures with same genes suddenly more/less fit to its environment without any mutation occurs needed. For example dodo bird of Madagascar. They lives just fine for who knows how many hundreds of thousand of years in Madagascar. Then suddenly the dutch come in 1598 and starts to pick them up for dinner and introduce invasive species like dogs. And in less than a century they went extinct. They got natural selection-ed out of this world without any mutation happened to their gene needed.

 We have teams like TI5 Secret bombing out and CDEC 2nd place. Newbee and VG owning TI4 out of nowhere.  TNC with nobodies+demon eliminating TI6 OG. RNG knocking out TI9 VP. C9 eliminating Navi TI4. DC TI6 2nd place. Half the fucking results each TI are an enigma if you based it Pre-TI performance

TI almost always never followed who owned, who sucked and who did mediocre pre-TI.

This also gives a lot of room to find a creative position 5 or someone who s4 thinks complements him in terms of drafting/ingame calls and so on. Alliance is taking a chance and it might pay off, it might also end up crashing down, but taking a chance I think is the right call if they didn't think that the team was going to improve with it's past lineup.",2020-04-01 20:04:31

Of course you are probably wondering why, well ill have you know he is simply perfect.

Not in the way you might expect however, he makes me shudder with disgust every time my eyes graze his model.

It is a true tragedy, but one I endure for the greater good, the true enlightenment.

Cursed, I am, with this knowledge. But what is it you fools are missing? Well, let me inform you cretins;

&#x200B;

It all began when the gracious Frozen-Amphibian-Of-Heavens graced us mortals with the even more divine presence of Mireska Sunbreeze.

So of course, as I dedicated myself to this goddess of a fairy, I would pick her every game. More than just picking her in game, I picked her in life.

&#x200B;

All of this of course, to show my pure devotion to her.

&#x200B;

For a while at least, everything was perfect. With each tower falling, every last hit and kill, my bond grew deeper and deeper.

Unfortunately however, I failed to realize something. I would consider it my biggest oversight.

Crumbled apart, the perfect reality. It was just another game, another virtual lifetime admiring her soft fluffy wings, her cute pixie feet.

Killed. She..-I was. I let her down. I failed her.

Impossible. Entranced with her even as she gracefully fell to the ground, I fell into a rage. What hideous creature would dare lay a finger on such a goddess?!?

Never had I ever seen such a beast. What virgin had the embarrassment of rubbing out this five-polygon cumstain people think deserves to be on my screen?!?

Galvanized with rage, I immediately went to buyback. But before I could, what I witnessed stunned me more than even Mireska's cursed crown ever could.

&#x200B;

Laying in front of my eyes, that watery diarrhea they call morphling, CHANGED. Into the-.. no, MY beautiful Mireska

Eclipsed by what I was witnessing, it slowly dawned on me. THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE DARK WILLOW

Giddy with excitement, groaning as I held the urge of coming on the spot; I had to wait for my goddess. There was work to be done.

Even though it hurt, I knew I could no longer choose her in every match. Without seeing her luscious lips, it was nearly too much to bare.

Nothing could stop me from my dream. I pick morphling every game. As soon as the match starts, he's all mine.

Do you imbeciles finally understand? Imagine the most perfect and radiant goddess in existence. Now imagine that there are two of her.

&#x200B;

Each one of them is an unbelievably sexy queen, with her tight wooden ass. Now imagine them fighting. Pounding some lucky victim into submission.

Binding whatever.. -whoever they want with their sharp thorny ropes. Completely immobilizing them, while they do what they please.

Taunting them ever the while, in their incredibly sexy geographically ambiguous accent.

Just the promise that it might ever happen, that there will be a game where I can morph my pitiful model into my goddess is enough to keep me going.

In the meantime, every second I am forced to endure gazing at him, well its a virtual chastity cage, reminding me of my place and who I belong to.

I know release isn't an option, until the day when I see two of Mireska Sunbreeze.

7112,fm4igh7,comment,1585754763.0,1,"The Courier Deliver Items option works wherever you're on the map and whichever character you're currently selecting. As a result of pressing the hotkey, the courier will automatically retrieve your stash items and deliver them to you.

The Take Stash Items option doesn't automatically deliver items to you. It just puts whatever is in your stash in your courier (or hero if you're doing it while the hero is selected and you're at the fountain).

The Retrieve Items option works exactly like the Courier Deliver Items, the only difference is that you have to click your courier in order to access the hotkey (which is a courier's ability).

If you want to just retrieve items without delivering them you want to hit the Take Stash Items hotkey while selecting your courier. The only reason I could see that being useful is if your 6 stash slots are being taken and you need to stock more. I don't think this ever happens in a typical configuration game though.

Edit: If your courier is on the map, there is indeed no way to tell it to simply run back to the fountain and retrieve the items without delivering them. But why would you want to do that?",2020-04-01 15:26:03

Essentially, the game already has checks for things like intentional feeding, griefing, etc but it doesn't seem to use them because Valve is worried that it might cause false positives/accidental bans. 

What if we combine this flagging system and reports though? If someone goes 0-25 and the system marks them as a feeder, then each report they receive has double or triple the effect. 

For pro players, this could be done by enabling reports/bans. So if a pro player is marked as a feeder, then reports actually do something and they get banned/LP instead of a manchild like mason being able to feed every other game and not facing any consequences just because they were at a Valve event 6 years ago",2020-04-01 09:44:21

7159,fm3r570,comment,1585733866.0,-26,"thats a bullshit excuse. around that time the report system was very sensitive and reports had too much power. Now reports are useless they dont do anything. Everyone was getting low priority although singsing was getting more, that was because even his own party stack kept trolling him and reporting singsing. 

I can get 9 gameplay reports right now and 4 communication abuse and still wont get low priority. Thats how bad the system is.

Thats why we need overwatch system but reddit is fucking dumb and doesnt know how it can be applied and save games. They keep repeating ""you cant tell game ruining in dota2 like in csgo"" but you actually can if valve spent just a month to make a good overwatch system with clearcut rules with whats considered bad and what is not. Dota 2 doesnt even have a set of rules for your expected behaviour ingame (gameplay or social wise).

Basically everything is a result of valves really off hands approach when it comes to Dota 2 and let everything ""self regulate"" through their garbage automated systems in place and refusal to punish pro players and streamers.

There have been so many pro player/streamer clips and threads in rdota2 frontpage through the years varying from account boosting, smurfing, intentionally ruining games, deleting items, toxic people including racism, violent speech, abusing bots to get out of low priority, crashing servers and none of them got banned.",2020-04-01 09:37:46

I didn't say anything in chat, I didn't say anything to my teammates, I didn't farm KDA and tried winning as fast as possible. Reports for butthurt people were enough to put me in lpq. 

So yeah, people realized this and started abusing it towards others. Even people like Dendi were punished and he didn't really seem to the type of person who would get reports for communication abuse. It is why Valve changed it so penalties do nothing in custom/private lobbies.

The system got changed but it still is heavily flawed in a lot of aspects. But if anything I want to believe you can no longer get punished for picking Techies.",2020-04-01 14:22:55

I'm only ever toxic to people that give up/gg out when the game isn't over. It's only over when the ancient falls, etc.

I think that the system currently punishes toxic players fine while not punishing innocent players. You have to be pretty toxic to get punished, so it doesn't negatively affect players that aren't toxic, which is the most important thing.

Remember, there's a trade off: while reducing toxicity is important, you have to trade off the negative effect that toxicity has with the negative effect that wrongly punishing non-toxic players has on those players. Non-toxic players getting punished because they had a bad game is *really* bad for player retention. A lot of people will just not play the game if they get LP for having a bad couple of games in a row. They'll leave. I've seen it happen loads of times.

Yeah, maybe there are cases that would be caught, but the question is how prevalent it is. Scripting is a lot rarer than aimbot/wallhacking is in CSGO, and the effectiveness of the OW system would require constant user activity. If scripting is too rare, people will lose interest in taking part because the likelihood of getting a legit case is so low.

That makes no sense at all. The majority of people in low prio are there for abandoning games due to either rage-quits or bad connections, not for being reported for intentional feeding. 

Your calculation also ignores behaviour score: even if 2% of players are griefers, that doesn't mean that you have a 2% chance of each of the other 9 people in the game being a griefer. If you have 3k behaviour score there's probably a 50% chance there's a griefer in your game (which doesn't necessarily mean they'll grief in *this* game), if you have 10k behaviour score there's probably a 0.5% chance you have a griefer in your game.",2020-04-02 02:27:03

7435,fm3m4s1,comment,1585728471.0,39,"The first thing I notice is at (2:20) you have 740 gold just sitting there not buying anything.   It's very important to spend your gold as you get it and have your courier send it out to you.  It does nothing for you just sitting in your stash.  Watch a pro player farming safelane and they will constantly be ferrying out items and regen to themselves using their courier/teammate.

Secondly, you bought a ton of regen and you aren't being aggressive at all in lane.  Void can trade pretty well with monkey king-- consider these numbers from (2:20):

Void: 800 health, 67 damage, 4 armorMK: 720 health, 59 damage, 2 armor

How do I know these numbers?  Because I'm clicking on MK all the time as I'm watching your replay.  You have to scout your lane opponent from time to time and see what level he is, how much stats he has etc. because that should be what drives how aggressive you are.  You absolutely HAVE to become more aware of other heroes in the game-- check their items check their levels etc.

So who wins that trade?  You do, hands down.  Just eat tangoes and hit him constantly in between CS, otherwise it's a complete waste to buy 2x tangoes and a salve + 1 pooled tango.

(6:00) is a perfect example.  You have 715 health, 7 armor and 83 damage, 3 points in timelock and you're wearing level 2 ion shell.  MK is way out of position and wasted his stun.   He has 534 health,  3 armor.  Who cares if he has 3 jingo stacks, you not only shred him but you can timewalk off the damage.  One timelock proc and he is dead.

You maybe won your lane, and farmed well, but this guy is just begging you to feed off of him and you aren't doing it.  The easiest way to get out of 1k is punish your opponents when they make a mistake, because they will be making a LOT of mistakes.  If that MK was standing way up there in lane in a divine game he will die instantly.

Just to harp on this point (I'm still paused at 6:00).  You clearly know how to CS in lane.  You understand creep aggro decently.  You're building solid item choices (double wraith band is nice).  If you get a huge advantage like this one, use it to crush the game!  Playing too passive when you are ahead is almost as bad as playing too aggressive when you're behind.  You know going into it that the enemy team will be pretty weak early and then they'll outscale you if the game stalemates and goes past 30 minutes (most games at your bracket go past 30 minutes).  So use your advantage while you have it, and get a free win if a stupid offlane MK is offering it to you.  (No offense to the MK player if he happens to see this).

At 8:15 you have another free kill on MK and don't take it..

Let's talk about item choices.  Is maelstrom really nice to have on void? Yeah.  Is it any good against their lineup?  I personally think no for a couple reasons.  First of all, the maelstrom procs have been nerfed quite a bit recently, and they are going to tickle antimage if you chrono him later on.  Secondly, if I'm playing safelane void vs silencer my first thought is ""I should consider going manta this game and then maybe diffusal.""  It's really easy to play the hindsight game and my just criticize your items but I'm just looking at the draft saying naked mjollnir is not going to have any impact here.

After you finally win your lane at 10 minutes you just... leave.  For the next 8 minutes MK is getting great farm top and AM is free farming bot.  You are the strongest hero on the map and chrono is up and you are just jungling while they pressure two of your towers.As a result, look at the networth graph at 16 minutes when you finally get maelstrom.  AM and MK both have the same networth as you even though you spent that entire time jungling!  If you were in my game I'd think you were griefing because you aren't rotating to any lanes, enemy has all three tier 1 towers and you haven't joined a single fight.  If you aren't fighting and you aren't pushing wtf are you doing?  Lanes give WAY more gold than jungle, if you don't want to farm enemy creeps and pressure towers then don't play carry.

20 minutes in you're still jungling, you haven't use chrono or hit an enemy tower in 10 minutes.  You said you watch pro players and copy what they do-- watch someone play faceless void and see if they spend 10 minutes after laning phase timewalking through the jungle and never pushing lanes at all.

Not only is your team losing fights because you aren't there, but you're losing towers because you aren't pushing lanes.  The only time you use TPs is to go back to your own jungle to farm.  For some reason you've been griefing the royal jelly in your inventory for 10 minutes too, what's that about?  Do you just want to punish your team for being unlucky enough to be matched with you or did you forget it was there?

At 24:50, your first chrono in 14 minutes (this skill has a 2:30 minute cooldown, you can use it like 10 times in 30 minute game) you chrono MK who is already dead and you also catch pudge and WK in the chrono too, setting enemies up for a super easy teamfight.  Why not use it on the enemy squishy heroes in the back line, you have a full mjollnir you can kill silencer and earth shaker easily And they are both showing on your map.

I'll stop watching at this point.  I hope my criticism wasn't too harsh.  It looks like you know the basics of farming in lane but you should have killed MK several times in early game and you should have been farming lanes, pressuring towers and using chronosphere for pick offs in the mid game.  Instead you just AFK farmed your own jungle and then chrono'd your own team when you finally had a chance to make a play.",2020-04-01 08:07:51
7436,fm3o4e2,comment,1585730611.0,7,"During the laning stage you should try and learn how to manipulate creep aggro. There were a lot of times where you could have pulled the creeps to a better position to ensure a last hit where instead you just sat there waiting for the creeps to come to you. 

Don't be afraid to trade right clicks a bit more, you have Time Walk which makes you quite hard to take down in the laning stage, with double Ion Shell you and Dar Seer could bully them out of the lane with a low chance of death because of Time Walk and Surge. Instead you both happily traded with the enemy team which allowed Monkey King to have a much better game.

You need to use Chronosphere more, you used it twice in the first 25 minutes of the game. The rest of the time you farmed. Try and find more opportunities to use Chronosphere. Defending a tower, smoking out with a teammate or two that can get a kill. You can also push objectives as a team while you have Chronosphere up and then go back to farming while it is on cooldown.

When you use Chronosphere, they have to be better. You have to ensure that your team is close enough to do damage during it, and you also have to avoid hitting your team. They were too early for your team to follow up, too late where your team had already died or badly positioned where it actually benefited the enemy team more than your own team.",2020-04-01 08:43:31
7437,fm59gxc,comment,1585768788.0,2,"Shove lanes.  And rotate to defend objectives, look before you TP to see if you and your chrono will be useful.  Add those two concepts to your farming focus and your mmr will go up.  There's a lot more to learn from there.  You don't know how competent random players you never met will be on a hero or role.  So your expectations could be completely wrong as it pertains to their abilities to do what you want them to do.  So you need to employ universal concepts that are always positive for the team until you can get a better understanding of your teammates abilities.  Shoving lanes gives you better farm than jungle, provides map control and information on where the enemy is and it defends objectives as the enemy will need to defend the lane you shove.  Looking and fighting under your objective gives you a fight with an advantage, you can see the entire situation and you get to make the judgement knowing more variables than your opponent on whether or not your attendance will sway a fight in your favor.",2020-04-01 19:19:48
7438,fm3pftz,comment,1585732046.0,1,"Probably the best piece of advice would be pick a hero that hits towers and clears waves fast, because the truth is your team comp is just weird and that's not your fault, pudge+cm off lane just feels bad and the WK mid shouldn't have gone even with the silencer needless to say you have a Dark Seer as your hard support just pushing the lane.

People at this MMR make many mistakes be it at the picking phase to lanes, itemisation, teamfights to high ground, what you personally need to do is just farm quicker than the enemy (you'll need to forget this once you raise because farming faster won't win higher level games automatically, but the simple fact people won't defend towers before crusader is what IMO you should focus on first) It's about realising what bracket your playing in and picking up what you would consider to be bad habits, i.e. I just played Shadow Shaman (roughly) 600 to 1.2k mmr and pushed lanes and took early racks... 1.2 to 1.8 i played invis heros to take advantage of the fact the enemy buys little detection. Weaver is a hero that can play any lane and fits the desciption for hitting towers and pushing lanes.

Again IMO it can be damaging to try and play the game the way it's 'supposed' to be played at too low mmr because every game is just such a s#!t show, so if you have a set hero, a set build that you know what you're doing better than anyone else in these games you will have a huge impact every game until you reach a level where it no longer is viable, then you can start letting go of the bad habits and practise what you should be doing",2020-04-01 09:07:26

There is no incentive to try in these tourneys knowing you have guaranteed spot at TI if you're a T1 team, they can all just take a break for a year (If TI 2020 doesn't happen) and nothing of value will be lost.

It’s only obvious to you because of the additional information you have. We can also pile onto it that you’re literally under zero pressure while watching so you have all the time in the worth to theorycraft various things that could be happening in the game. The way youre talking here, literally every play any team makes is super obvious because of what’s going on because it’s happened before in another game.

The old system was pretty much a) go with the strat you had in mind or b) counter pick the enemy hero that picks before you. This new system punishes lineups that don't consider cheese picks. Thay means teams need to have a foresight of potential cheese picks. One solution I had in mind was that the player on your team needs to think of a hero that completes your lineup or waste a few gold, but wait for the last pick and choose a hero that counters their would be cheese hero.

Huskar is way too unkillable with way too little networth. Vessel being charge based, and somewhat expensive is annoying and sometimes by the time uve got it huskar has bkb.


Meepos tempo was balanced by having him need aghs first. Making stat share innate was a huge mistake and lowered the skill of the hero since you dont use 5 meepos anymore

Lycan doesnt care about anything. He can feed in lane no one cares as long as he can reach his dom necrobook. Hero needs to be changed so that he needs other items,probably by massively nerfing his base stats or passive or ms so he needs upgraded boots or the like so he cant just run no boots dom necrobook and get away with it....nerfing his int alot would go a long way paired with the necro manacost increase.



And maybe unpopular opinion but i think solo roshing should be next to impossible in sub 20 mins unless you are like a ursa with a vlads. Many of these cheese heroes just win off sneaking a rosh on their own. Huskar shouldnt be able to feed then solo rosh with just an armlet",2020-04-01 17:35:55

Brood have some trouble in beginning without much spiders, if she can't make a big stack of them - she cant farm efficiently, and all timings are gonna be late for few minutes, which gives you good chance against her. Against husk you make spirit wessel 1 item, and kill the fucker as often as his respawn timer allows, he farms kinda slowly so recovering from his bad earlygame gives you enough time to get your critical mass and shit on him.

For 3. LC can trade just fine with slark, you hit him once cast Q hit him one more time and back off.Tha'ts not a good trade for slark. You can also mirror his orb of venom and buy one of your own since LC has 330 movement speed. Many slarks tend to think they can be aggreissve against an LC and usually tilt hard when they realise it's not possible.
Bounty hunter as a pos 3 is pretty devastating as well if you can handle the initial team flaming of your team questioning it.
Weaver is another one which is impossible to counter on the lane.
Keep in mind it's a matter of playstyle as well, i like these heroes more than traditional offlaners who lose their lane ez to slarks/naixs/lancers and kind of pray for the 2 main cores to have a good game. I treat these heroes as i would if i was playing pos 1 with the difference of farming and playing very aggressive and not griefing the team hard by sucking space and farming in safe areas. That means i dont waste gold on buying blink on LC, on weaver i rush diffusal with the levle 15 mana burn talent because slarks and lancers really don't like a taste of their own medicine they like to burn your mana but it gives them so much problems when you can play the same. For bh i have recently a lot of success with phase+soul ring+ MoM+ Desolator/Bkb if its  hard game. MoM alllows me to jungle and not fall behind to enemy carry when the map feels hard to find track kills.

Huskar is overrated, you need an early spirit vessel and you watch him fuck himself every fight till he doesn't even matter anymore.

These two heroes need to constantly apply pressure and they want to choke your team in base till your team is too underfarmed to defend. Kunkka prevents that from happening. That's all.

And then there are illusion heroes against whome Kunkka is pretty good with a decent item build. All his abilities are massive AEO damage that's a mix between magical and physical.

I am not saying Kunkka is auto win or anything, he is just a great hero to pick maybe 3rd or 4th in your team so your carry and offlaners can respond to cheesers while Kunkka himself is great at salvaging a terrible Laning phase cuz he can jungle.

Role queueing was a thing since Dota-plus came(at least that's when I remember it).

I might be wrong, but it's a Dota+ feature.

Edit: it was a battlepass feature.

So what Valve is saying is ""we're balancing the game around playing as a team, but for you to form a team you need to give us money"".

7945,fm348u2,comment,1585712470.0,11,"Let's look at the facts. Disclaimer I'm in divine bracket but have climbed from 1k mmr so I know the trench very well. 

Percentage wise most players are 2k mmr. The average is crusader something or archon 1. 

Now what is the world going through? A pandemic. Which means quarantine, which means a shitton of bored people in their homes, which means that Jim from accounting who's getting a promotion and living with his lovely wife suddenly had a ton of free time he didnt have before. 

So he does what he used to do when he had nothing to do as a teenager. Play dota. 

This is going on in all skill brackets. 

It stands to reason that I barely notice it because there aren't many old divine 5k mmr players returning to the game. (5k mmr is top 2% of all dota players, a super small population). 

But our crusader and below friends are like 50%  of the total population

Thus, games on crusader bracket are super volatile skill wise, as most returning crusaders are now heralds ir simply are still adapting to the changes. 

And yeah, that's pretty much it man. 

Obvious solution? Party up with friends? Don't have friends? Look for party mates here or in other dota related subs.",2020-04-01 03:41:10

7950,fm47gtg,comment,1585748325.0,1,"Here's the biggest problem now.

Smurf players have their own courier. They get 3 town portals. Little core items are even better now. This almost guarantees a relatively smooth start in lower bracket games where there's no advanced ganker looking for couriers or pressuring.

Smurf player then wins lane, ganks, or smurf player then clears 1-3 neutral camps and gets an even bigger lead.

The smurf uses his position to build space and allow his terrible team to catch up and carry as well.

I actually lost my main ranked account, so I'm somewhat of a smurf myself now. And every game I lane mid it's a complete snowball in my bracket. I purposely don't lane mid",2020-04-01 13:38:45

My parents make a combined of 130k usd annually, which puts me at a better standard of living than a lot of peruvians, and more than 80% of americans. Peru has 25 regions in total, think about it like ""states"", and all the wealth is focused on like 3, or 4 of them. It's if like in the US there was only significant wealth in California, New York, and Florida, every single other state was a shithole and full of poor people.

Source: https://dqydj.com/household-income-percentile-calculator/

And considering cash lasts longer in Peru than the US, my standard of living is actually way more sustainable than most americans, and living paycheck to paycheck is not something I will ever experience or have ever known, but my experience not representative at all of the average peruvian lifestyle, however, lots people in my city have similar standards of living as mine. As I said, very concentrated wealth. 

The clothing I spoke about is high quality super expensive clothing due to the quality of the wool used to manufacture them. The people making them make some bank. It gets exported but the richer peruvians can easily afford it.

8048,fm43od5,comment,1585745690.0,0,"Regardless of how the wealth is distributed in Peru it doesn’t change the fact that the average per capita is $5000. Wealth distribution has a lot to do with competency of local governments which would require the average Peruvian citizen to be over 10IQ.

Money “lasts longer” in Peru because 95% of your population lives in shacks with dirt floors and couldn’t afford to pay the prices Americans can easily pay for day to day items. The store owners in Peru realize this and lower their prices so they can actually move product. It’s simple economics 101; supply and demand curves

Your parents make a combined 130k a year? That’s only like 65k a piece before taxes which is pretty shit to be honest. 

Your parents are an outlier of an otherwise very unintelligent country that can barely sustain a functioning economy because of the culture and mentality of the people. 

Your parents have a better standard of living* their achievements have nothing to do with you. 


Edit: the entirety of Peru is like las Angela’s. Garbage and human feces on the streets. 

It’s a shame the Spanish weren’t more thorough when they were there to instill some order. 

It’s clear that Peruvian culture doesn’t provide sustainable living and also proves that Peruvians need a master (like the Spanish) to keep them from destroying their own country. We just need to reopen the Spanish gold mines and send your people back to work. I think they would be much happier as a subservient race. 

At the end of the day you’re just a Maricon and always will be no matter how much your parents resemble a middle class American household LOL",2020-04-01 12:54:50

wrong. Throwing numbers based on feelings is not very intelligent of you, wouldn't you agree?

> can barely sustain a functioning economy because of the culture and mentality of the people

Agree in the culture and mentality of the people though I wouldn't know much about functioning economy, we're certainly not a war torn country about to fall into anarchy, I would use flourishing economy definitely. The economy is sustainable enough, but will not flourish any time soon bar some changes and reduction of corruption in government officials and focus on education.

8050,fm45w9d,comment,1585747267.0,1,"“Education is very important” 

Ding ding ding! We have a big brain here ladies and gentleman! 

This is the reason why central/South American countries will never be considered valuable for anything other than exports of raw goods. Your culture doesn’t value education and never will because the current culture will be perpetuated generation after generation. I was being dramatic with the 95% statistic just like you were being dramatic when you were trying to convince me that the average Peruvian is rocking $500 “small ponchos.” But over 1/3 of your population lives in poverty by Peruvian standards. That means like 85% of your population is living in poverty based on US standards. 


Peruvian culture and their general level of education almost completely mirror that of Somalia. Look at the condition of both of these countries in relation to neighboring countries, it’s pretty obvious that some synapses aren’t firing at full capacity in the brains of both people groups. 

The people who make over 100k in Peru usually got there through unethical or corrupt means. These same people are usually the ones in Peruvian government. They don’t want to go back to the Peruvian standard of living so they perpetuate laws and manipulate law enforcement protocols to maintain their status as a pig among guinea pigs. 

You have a skewed view of your country because you live in the most Americanized and prosperous city. Why do you think it’s Americanized and people frequently eat at chili’s and McDonald’s? It’s because the people that live their have a little bit more money than average and realize that PERU IS A SHITHOLE which is why they desperately try to make it into their little slice of America which is the exponentially more superior country/culture/people.",2020-04-01 13:21:07
8051,fm470t2,comment,1585748031.0,2,"> desperately try to make it into their little slice of America which is the exponentially more superior country/culture/people.

Not really, people with money in a prosperous city will try to have a good standard of living and a very urbanized city. The US doesn't have a trademark on that. 

People with cash will try to live a high quality life, that doesn't mean they're desperately trying to emulate the states lol. 

Anyways man, It's been a pleasure talking to you but for some reason you're very passive aggressive which is off-putting. It's like you're arguing with me or something man cool it down.

I wasn't try to imply that the average Peruvian had 500$ ponchos, that was my bad lol didn't communicate my idea properly.

My city is not Americanized, I think that's kind of arrogant, my city is just urbanized and developed really.

As a fun side note, everybody here thinks McDonalds is ass, Bembos blows it out of the water. Apparently KFC is much more delicious here than in the US for some reason. 

When I went to Florida for work I did notice a very big difference in taste between Peruvian KFC and Mcdonalds and the american versions. KFC being pretty bad in comparison to the peruvian branches and MCD being super delicious compared to the ones here in Lima. Interesting huh?",2020-04-01 13:33:51

You’re intended to try your best to win the game. You probably won’t win, but give it your best shot. Then after the game you click the little red flag and report the person.

Over time the guaranteed losses and guaranteed wins should even out so that factor shouldn’t matter statistically (funnily enough unless you are a thrower yourself you should *win* more than you *lose* because there are 5 potential throwers on the enemy team and only 4 on yours).

Pos 3 (offlane) - WK (tanky, blink-stun is solid), Tide (Hard to kill, ravage is super simple), Bristle (just a lot of fun and hard to kill. simple enough hero too)

Pos 4 (soft support) - Lion (Stun, Mana drain and ult are so easy), Ogre (hard to kill and bully), Zeus (Hard to play, but with some guidance on positioning and spamming clarities early, he loved the hero's dmg output and global nature)

Find yourself a pool of up to ten heroes that you really enjoy, for you that would be heroes like Tide, Cent and Axe etc. 

Whittle that down to about three to five and that should be the best way of consistently gaining mmr whilst playing your favourite heroes.

Spamming one hero specifically can work but makes you a ""one trick pony"" so should only be done if they are super meta or you've grinded 500 games on them at minimum and can play them blindfolded with your arms tied behind your back.",2020-04-01 01:11:53

Also, the picks depend on what you're team is made of, and also the enemy's. Still, if you're looking for offlaners with impact, pick Mars, maybe phoenix, pit lord, I don't know.

If we are talking about buffing the hero, the only thing he really needs is for his Ion shell to be undispellable.

*  The Ion shell dominate would be broken. Just give him a free helm of dominator? 

* Ion shell applying surge is also ridiculous. 

* Vacuum is Dark seer's best ability in teamfights. It does not need a crazy buff.

* Able to teleport himself or allies to an Ion shell or illusion? Why? All of dark seers abilities are really strong and are already fine as they are.",2020-04-01 01:33:01

8215,fm2uuen,comment,1585705937.0,1,"BF/mjollnir/Radiance all can help clear illusions. Orchid, sheep, and abyssal can stop him from making them. The heroes doesn’t have any amazing item counters, but plenty of his counters are common enough that picking one (or more) of them up as part of your build wouldn’t be too insane either.

Or if you’re playing support (so your goal is more just not dying rather than killing PL) I’d point you at both glimmer capes or more directly ghost scepters, which can buy plenty of time to let you cast your spells and potentially get away.

Alternatively the biggest counter against a PL is simply pressuring early. The hero isn’t really unstoppable even without counters until he has diffusal plus like 2 more big items (usually manta+something tanky). That means you’ve got about 25 minutes to get a solid lead and set yourself up for the win, longer if you get in some good ganks on the hero or you’re playing at a low MMR where people don’t farm as well.",2020-04-01 01:52:17

You say move on but im not quite sure how that is done in dota. In League of Legends they have a concede feature. Also you say to report, but there is no accountability on reports because valve never looks at reports and therefore they require much more games to be ruined than in, say, league of legends where they actually have people who look at reports and that should be possible in dota as well since dota has less players and therefore less reports to look at",2020-03-31 20:58:50

There is no other way to move on while ingame other than still try to win or let the enemy team end. After the game is over its up to each individual player to report the griefer or not.

just pick safely? i don't see how a 50-50 shot of getting counter picked was 'more skill'

most of the strong mid heroes don't have any heavy counters atm. sf? void? lina? they are strong b/c they flash farm and are strong laners so they have very few bad matchups. it makes mid player vs player instead of being so heavily based on who gets last pick and can get a free lane... so how is counter picking based on entirely random chance more skill than neither player counter picking? Now you get the freedom to work around your team instead of only picking a hero that wins their lane with no synergy otherwise

every other lane is expected to pick something safe too. that's why they're called 'safe'. you could pick antimage every game, but you'd rather pick terrorblade b/c he's more reliable right now. that's dota. you're free to pick a different hero, but you risk getting owned by a bad counter. that's why they aren't called safe picks, you pick them to go well with your lineup or if there's a limited number of options for the opponent and you know, in this game, that hero is a safe pick

&#x200B;

& your opponent is under the same circumstances. if you think they're gonna pick huskar, you can always counter their huskar or pick your own huskar if you don't want to be safe every game. but your opponent is also more likely to pick safe because they also never know if they're going to be a good counter pick or not",2020-03-31 22:15:19

A quick phase/tranquils and 2x bracer and a quicker level 6 means clock can use that ability to pressure around the map and even get solo kills pretty easily. 

The hero works well if you play it like that but unfortunately a lot of pub players are going to pick it and try and play it like a traditional offlaner and will probably farm *way* too much.

There's nothing wrong with playing more of a ""3.5"" style of hero though that starts off strong and then stops farming later -- especially in pubs where your 4 position might be real greedy.",2020-03-31 21:04:32

And I'd say clock's better on 3 because 1. the earlier you get 6 the better and 2. there are some super strong items for clock, phase boots allow you to approach without hook (in lane at least), blade mail is super strong and something like spirit vessel allows you to 1v1 basically anybody.",2020-03-31 20:23:02

I believe you now see why people don't really have sympathy for your predicament. Don't get me wrong, PA misplayed here. But while she did get killed, there is a silver lining to her death: Bristle got no XP from it. In fact, nobody from radiant did. And XP is far more important early than gold. On the other hand, you are a Dazzle that cast Grave early on a hero that had literally 0 chance of dying in that situation, and I can argue that the simple fact that you used Grave enabled Bristle to go aggressive and dive you guys.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here is a checklist of way forward

* [x]  Spawn courier
* [x]  Talk about F1 key to center your hero
* [x]  If levels gained are not spent then game would pause and request user to spend it on learning abilities
* [x]  At level 3 an enemy hero of easy level difficulty is spawned
* [x]  Low health and mana would now ask user to consume tango / clarity
* [x]  Talk about being able to combine items
* [x]  Talk about courier
* [x]  After acquiring required gold buy wraith band and use courier to get it
* [x]  Send courier to secret shop to complete manta and talk about secret shops
* [ ]  Pausing a game with F9
* [ ]  Talent tree

Advanced Tutorial later
* [ ]  Talk about barracks
* [ ]  Spawn a dd rune at 4 minutes
* [ ]  Talk about runes
* [ ]  Let luna get dd rune
* [ ]  Adding yasha to stash and buying each component
* [ ]  In case of death, TP to mid tower - bind TP to space key as by default its not linked to anything",2020-03-31 18:24:27

8686,fm3vk01,comment,1585738622.0,0,"skillbuild: lvl 1 shrapnel is good now. since the buff, it could significantly damaged the enemy resources at rune fight. Next, take headshot to trade better against enemy support/chipping at their cores or take aim if you want to take some cheap shot. But in any case, max shrapnell asap and headshot next, take aim later. The point is, you won't attack heroes much. hence taking headshot would be preferable to farm camps/push waves coupled with shrapnel. Talent, obviously take cd reduction and all shrapnel talents.   


Item wise: I prefer to just focus on my role first and what is needed for the game. And for the most part, pos 4 won't be needed as the main damage output. So my item build would be boots, (optional lace), sticks, (optional veil if its good for your team), (optional support item if it really is needed for the game, such as force against slark/riki etc), aghs, and hex/blink/SE as luxury item. The current aghs is very useful and provide something that he never be able to do before. stun + damage 700ish (before reduction) from 3k range. literally the only hero that could do that in dota (except if you count zeus's nimbus ministun).  


Playstyle: rune fight with shrapnel. keep shooting at the enemy at the laning stage. use shrapnel to trade. pull side camps.   
in team fight, your main priority is to give vision/DPS from shrapnel, cancelling blink or shooting healing wards using your take aim, veil enemies, disable with agh assassinate, or use your active items. you got 20% cd reduction, so try to get a lot of active item if possible.

Do not be tempted to attack during teamfight except it is 100% safe. I repeat. Do not try to attack except when you are 100% safe. Your main dps is shrapnel + assassinate. else are utilities.

  
try to stack if you got nothing to do. shrapnel lvl 2 can already help you clear stacks efficiently and bump your level/overall team networth.

8690,fm4fhz0,comment,1585753107.0,1,"it really depends of your goal in laning. if you want to pressure and get early level advantage, pushing lane + pulling big camps is a great move. If not, using shrapnel on enemy supports will make the trade always in your favor. not to mention you can always blow 3 whole charge if you really want to cover large area (try not to do it tho).

leveling headshot at lvl 1 was what I used to do when shrapnel damage was 10 at lvl 1. It is not bad, but the current shrapnel helps early fighting for rune/extra slow/harass before the laning even starts. just placing shrapnel at rune actually made your opponent to be inside it for at least 3-4 second + some extra attack too. overall, it is just better than headshot now (that has just been nerfed by 10 damage recently), utility and/or damage wise IMO. 

This being said however, if the opponents are 2 mele without any mechanism of catching you up/disable, headshot at your 1st lvl will worth much better than shrapnel.",2020-04-01 14:58:27

Because over 99% of them are trash or/and unfinished (and so, buggy af) or just aren't interesting. Also your source is kinda unreliable. (Source: lol why do you need source for comment on Reddit if it's not something important).

>four-team map. It was really interesting -- and no one played it, because it was a custom game.

No, it's not how it works. It's not an original idea (I think there might be three of them), it's not balanced (obviously, as Dota isn't with big dev-team working on it) it can be buggy (missing unit models due to enormous amount of them on the map at the same time in the late game (which also cause lags)) and more. It's not even something really changes unless you're playing the lane, that interacts with more than one team. And it's also not like you'd play it again because it gets boring after one or two games.

One of these kind of games was in top 10 for a bit after Reborn was released (source: tRuST mE)

It's not something you'd play for more than one or two games. Like the other guy who wants Dota to be Chess - if it's not something you want then Valve shouldn't even consider the idea. You just can't wrap your head around the idea that some people might enjoy some variety, that isn't marred by Valve's critical stupidity when it comes to custom games.

The four-team maps are an example. How about a 3v3 map? How about a 10v10 map?? NOOO I DON'T WANT THAT, VALVE'S ATTENTION MUSTN'T BE DIVERTED FROM FUNNY HATS",2020-04-01 08:57:07

P.S. I do want new contents in Dota but not this kind of content. You can make this as a custom game if you want. Nobody's stopping you.

But just don't tell Valve to waste their time making these ""silly maps"" that you want. It's better if Valve spend their time improving Dota 2 (better tutorial for new comers, better matchmaking, better game balance, etc.).",2020-03-31 19:31:43

8772,fm6u33w,comment,1585803270.0,1,"""maybe farm jungle safely"" is your number 1 priority to buy sentry? really? sentry makes u feel safe when u jungle?    buddy, the next time you are ""jungling"" and need to ""feel safe"" , try getting an obs down at the entrance to said jungle.   you'll be much safer and won't have wasted **75** gold, and 1/10 sentry stock limit. 

 As for my question, the correct answer for ""when should the core be absolutely buying a sentry"", is when u are 100% sure, (*that means you saw it yourself in person*) that they have an observer placed, which you can deward with a sentry.  And when u do that, Guess what? you just killed 1/4 of their limited obs stock, u got more than 100 gold for your 75 spent, which is a net gain and u got some xp from that ward. 

Ofc, another valid reason is if there is an invis enemy hero who can scout u and set you up, and you having the vision edge can get u a kill or save your life - **INSTEAD OF YOU DYING!** .  once again, you think you lost ~~90~~**75*** gold, when you actually gained Either a kill bounty(which you otherwise wouldn't be getting) Or saved {*deathcost* - 75} gold. 

Any other reason you are buying a sentry as a core, you are just wasting gold and stock. You are tilted that your support isn't buying wards, and you just want to show them up, buy them yourself, ruin your own game in the process, griefing the game for 2, maybe even 3 other people who gave their all in that game, and report your support at the end of the game for ""being a moron"".

Just adding something else here: If you want to feel ""safe"" while jungling, there are no wards dwn, and you are the non-expendible core(aka win condition for your team), farm near where the majority of your team's heroes are. take the camps near the lane where atleast one of our allies are closeby. so, if they do jump someone , its more likely said ally, and not you. and worst case, if it is you who gets gone on, atleast you will have some form of backup closeby to get you a bail-out or atleast some sort of trade.",2020-04-02 04:54:30

Fixing these normally involve adding server side validation, and all client vs server issues normally come down to see how much processing you can do on the client side without giving the client too much control (as client input can never be assumed to be correct).

why not? I see it as totally valid. After all video games are a competition market, so its only fair to compare.

what has that to do with the argument of Valves lazy coding? It even strenghtens it, since Valve still lets stuff like this happen after 7 years. Its for a reason the ""game still in beta"" meme exists.

> What pre shipment testing do you want them to do right now

I dont know how this enemy hero control exploit works, but again, I point to the 100% game ruining last hit trainer exploit, that was fixed by one line of code a freshman could write. Valve simply messed up, happens,

8890,fm42lbm,comment,1585744877.0,4,"So a quick research says that on average, ventilators found it hospital ICU costs on average USD$25-50k. Probably more now as the demand for ventilators have skyrocketed.

3 days ago, states in the US were looking at USD$45k for a new ventilator. So naturally it will cost more if it is imported (assuming those 45k ones are made in the US themselves).

Now, don't forget, that when we talk about ventilators in a hospital settings, it is not just about the mechanical unit itself (which cost around USD$1k to 5k) but also the rest of it (I.e monitoring, flow rate, oxygen, humidifier, etc).

Also, hospitals would be using more complex/complicated ventilators to be able to treat the worst types of breathing problems, so some of the cheap ones currently out there just don't cut it for the amount of work they are required to performed.

A lot of ventilator websites don't show prices, mostly a contact us with a large number of their products being out of stock.

Sorry for the lack of research, I couldn't find much on the cost of the ventilators and scientific journal articles were more focused on home care ones (which can range between 5k to 25k depending on the needs, and a monthly cost of 8k+ upwards, while others said they were just expensive. Articles are not free to access).

Edit 2: A bit more on ventilators if you want to know more. There are two types of ventilators, Positive Pressure ventilators (gives lungs air) and negative pressure ventilators (suck air out). For CoVid-19, we need positive pressure ventilators. If you want to understand how it works, read the link below!

The funds will be donated to the international funds CEPI and Global Giving.

Twenty four teams are participating in a seven-day event that starts on March, 20 — with back-to-back TI champions OG, multiple Major winners Team Secret, famous Team Nigma, NAVI, Virtus.pro, and others.

9215,fm3a4w1,comment,1585717011.0,12,">winning TI is a team achievement

Yes, an achievement which came about because Ceb was and is so good at creating a positive, non-pressurizing atmosphere in his team - a trait in Dota that is extremely rare, if not actually unique, to him and n0tail. This is evident in both True Sights, where he's shown to be the mental leader of the team. In contrast, both LGD and Liquid visibly cracked under this pressure when it came on them in game 5/game 4 respectively, and began blaming players and coaches for their losses. Further, Ceb won many games for OG almost by himself whether by drafting or through ingenious play - the famous Axe call at TI8, or first item Spirit Vessel Legion Commander against iceiceice's Timbersaw at TI9. 

Ceb is by no means the most mechanically gifted offlaner of all time, but his level of skill was nonetheless high enough to help OG win two TI's back to back (and hard carry in the most difficult game of those two tournaments, which was game 4 against LGD). If you consider the drafting, the unique item builds and the mental fortitude he provided ana et al., you have to admit that he is the most cerebral offlaner of all time. That alone makes him worthy of GOAT status.

He may only have played two years, but his overall impact on the best Dota 2 team of all time cannot be underestimated. He is a GOAT, no way around it. Longevity is not a hard prerequisite to be a GOAT; it is only a very good heuristic, which happens to be wrong here.",2020-04-01 04:56:51

Which is unfair to people who dominated on different teams, with different teammates in different times over most of their careers. That is the reason I say he is overrated.

I am not saying he is a bad player by any means, he is just not the best player in dota mechanically, or by career achievements. He won 2 Tis but he never won anything else.

1. burning (very personal, when i started playing dota I watched shit ton of his replays and really really respect him overall)

2. Puppey (nothing to say. Dominated with NAVI, dominates with secret)

3. Fear (face of NA dota since dota allstars)

4. Lanm (one of the best supports and played since TI1, Big Dick Lanm he is)

5. Mushi (singlehadedly lifted SEA region from being easily the worst region and was on most competitive international SEA squads until recently)

6. Kuroky (NAVI, secret, liquid. Years of being on great teams)

7. Universe (best NA offlaner ever to live, was considered best offlaner overall prob since mid-late 2014 to 2016 or 2017)

8. PPD (U can;t leave top3 captain after kuroky and puppey out of this list)

9. Dendi (Face of Dota from 2011 to 2014-2015. sure he didn;t have same accolades as kuroky and puppey post great navi rosters which is why he is lower)

10. Sumail/Miracle. I consider them pretty even and hard for me to decide. as EG fan I like sumail more, but both are not long enough in Dota for me to put em higher. Baically I think at the end of their careers they could move to any spot including 1st in my list, but not yet)

obviously u see some shift towards EG 2015 players as I am an EG fan, but for real that was one of the best teams to ever exist. winning Ti and DAC aka first major and at that point considered almost as important as TI. They were monsters.",2020-04-01 05:52:10

On top of that even in situations where you have plenty of time to react *how* you need to react changes. as /u/Swiindle mentioned, if you need to manta dodge, lets say a Light Strike Array, it has a really late cast point so that's easy to dodge, but manta only has 100ms split time, so if you press manta at the same time as before, by the time the server recieves your manta command, you've already been stunned.",2020-04-01 13:19:49

True. Trust me, we're aware. And even though all the hentai's nice and all, we sorta wish it weren't the case and we had more 'monstrous' and 'badass' designs. 

And on the flip side, I can't help but wish Dota had *a few* more hot grills. Not many, just a few. I mean, Icefrog clearly has the 'expertise' if Dark Willow is anything to go by. A few more wouldn't really  hurt.

Even if you got Stone RIGHT at 15 minutes in and used it all the way till a better Tier 3, you're only getting ~700 gold out of it. 700 in 10 minutes is hardly anything, especially at ~10-25 minutes into the game. It todays patch some games are nearly over around 25 minutes.

I'd still probably prefer the keen optic especially as I probably already have Arcane boots by the time a philosphers stone shows up. I also may just already have Faded Broach at this time, and I'd *way* rather have the extra movespeed and not have a debuff then a super tiny GPM boost that can be compensated for by *literally* just 2-3 last hits a minute. Hell I'd argue for a lot of supports in low MMR the stone probably makes them miss more last hits worth of gold than they even get from the buff.

> Certain heroes like Disruptor for example care about nothing but getting their Aghs

Im not 6k player but this does not seem true at all. You'd want probably at least 1 defensive item before aghs or you're probably never getting there. Also better items will come along before then including tier 3s.

>  for these heroes the item is a god send

Disagree, again rather have most any other item. 

> Supports don't last hit 

They do in normal/low MMR because cores miss out on farm left and right. Its more efficient to snag the farm when you can than get an item like Philosophers stone and watch that farm go to literally no one.

> and if they do they are using their spells.

what?!? You're saying supports never get CS with their right click?

If you cant find two last hits as a pos 5 then you must be playing with a VERY efficient team that is cleaning up every single last hit. Most people dont play in that kind of environment though so the item is terrible for its timing compared to most others.",2020-04-01 15:40:29

Except they help with more than farming... where as the GPM of the Stone doesn't. All the stone does outside of farming is gimp your damage and give you 200 mana.

9707,fm1xv1u,comment,1585686978.0,1,"I've played clock as 4 and 5 for at least half a year, and almost always get whatever makes me a tanky mfer who can run/hook in without the fear of death. And if they do mange to kill me, it should be while wasting at least half their spells and with at least one hero on the wrong side of my cogs.

That is *very* often a hood/pipe and one of these: spirit vessel, blade mail, solar crest, vlads. All depending on team composition and what we need. If someone else is, getting pipe, get two bracers instead before the next item.

Clock is very flexible when it comes to items in any game where he feels tanky. The exception is when the enemy is ahead or have a lot of tools to deal with you. Especially when they can just manfight and win or easily manouver around/out of cogs. A few of the worst opponents in this regard are lycan, am, brood, BM and pl. Meepo, qop, Chen and snapfire are also a pain to deal with. Anything with summons or blinks mote or less. In these cases you have to either play the blocking game, trying to some how limit where they can move where ever you can, or you have to try to make use of your stun as a second initiation or count er initiation. Either way, these are the match ups where you *HAVE TO* play with your team more than any other clock game.

Otherwise you are pretty much a useless asset to the team. I am an offlane player, what do I do if I cant get my pos 3 when practicing? I choose pos 4. It's the same lane, and as a bonus I get to learn how to support a pos 3 core efficiently. So when I DO get to play pos 3 I have an even greater understanding of what I would like to see from my lane support, and the difficulties my support might have. Vice versa... Same goes for safelane and even mid. 

Losing mmr is not a big deal? That's one way of looking at it. But to me completely counter intuitive. If it works for you... Great. Clearly isn't working for this guy and a bunch of people on my friends list. 

I guess there is no correct way to do it.

As for me mentioning skill level. I'm ancient 1 in ranked. All my unranked games are at low divine. I don't understand why, but every game is incredible. I played unranked for 6 months last year and then experienced the biggest ranked climb I've ever had immediately after.

To each their own I guess. But this guy in particular is clearly shooting himself in the foot and then making reddit posts about it. And finally spamming one hero when there are apps like dotaplus now... You'll just get banned out of the game in the lobby...

Just create system with few steps (the more you break the rules the greater the punishment): only ppl with high % banrate from players judged by ppl, first or second punishment give system but not that big, like 1 day or week ban, second 2 week or month and devs improve this overtime by loking at different stats:

if some player has some high % effective reports use, system preoretize this ppl more, vise versa or prioritize new players less because they don’t know exactly how this game works (if there is no system that determines smurfs by kda and other stats in the game)

more factors can be taken into account and indicated in the reports what everyone means and what you can report for

the fact that Valve doesn’t do this means only that they don’t want to spend time and money on it and transfer their responsibilities to the players, this is just a lazy approach in 2020",2020-03-31 13:44:42

but then again there is reason why majority of poe's league last for like 2 weeks, its cause depth simply isnt there as much as people like to say, sure you can always play game and enjoy it, but in the end its not like dota, i mean when i write stuff like this its gona look like im hating on poe, in reality as i said its definetly deep game, its just not as deep as dota thats about it and im pretty picky when i chose ""hardcore"" games",2020-03-31 19:05:56

Although even when you know everything it takes quite a bit of creative thinking to make up an interesting build. 

Then Idk if you were intentionally over-exaggerating that much with the 90% stat but [this](http://prntscr.com/rqdeet) is the current spread for classes **in high levels**, which is far far away from what you think. One skill kind of dominates the ladder quite a bit (Cyclone at 21% of high level chars, the rest is 9% or less) but I'd argue it's kind of PoE's Pudge, something that gets played a lot because it's fun and iconic, not really because it's OP.

Then
>items that are veiled below increadily low % when in reality you dont need it at all its mostly for personal pleasure

While it's true on some aspects of minmaxing (gems mostly I guess), it absolutely depends on your goals with the game. The game's most expensive items are **insanely** better than the ones the average player can get, and they are mandatory if you want to do crazy fun shit. But you're still kinda right in the sense you can clear the game on a very small budget if you are skilled enough



>also shitton of builds that pretty much revolve around 90% of same pasive skill nodes

Exaggerated, but still kind of true in its intention. Passive tree is not so much about choices, and more like the ""easiest side"" of min-maxing a character. [this](http://prntscr.com/rqdp6k) is the current heat map of the passive skill tree for the highest lvl chars.

>but then again there is reason why majority of poe's league last for like 2 weeks

Ehh this is exaggerated but yeah, a lot of people quit around the 1-1.5 month mark, but they mainly are people who play the game for 12h straight everyday starting from the beginning of the league. And it's not a majority of people that do so. 

Overall, your experience all depends on your goals with the game, but if you're the type of player that only wants to do the *best* thing, and clear the game as fast as possible with the best build of all, you won't enjoy it for long. But if like me you enjoy theorycrafting wonky shit (that still works very well, cause playing trash builds isn't fun) as much as playing the actual game, it's a game you can play 10 hours a day for a long time, trust me.",2020-03-31 19:36:19

You're right that it should be precised. Those are west eu stats which are the same for france and uk. 

Note that it is the percentage among people that split, not the percentage among all couples.

Basically the rate is 25% for married couples who split, and 50% for unmarried couple who split.

Now, there are cultures where people dont split at all, so the numbers dont apply.

Here, I live in a catholic area, people were not allowed to split. So what happened a lot was that men had girlfriends on the side and married women took their frustration on their kids and neighboors. Life was hell for most of them. But they wouldnt split.

Nowadays in my area it's mostly muslims who live like that, but since they dont even choose who they marry (it's an arrangement between the fathers), it doesnt even matter if they split or not.",2020-04-01 10:58:14

I follow you since Mouz, but I have to disagree when you said that match against EG was your best doto.

I still remember one match, against LGD, when you were in CIS, where you played a carry Naga Siren, from behind, your team was mostly stomped through the match, but you got Radiance and took over the game almost alone. I think it was TI qualifiers? Not sure.

It was one of the most impressive performances I've ever seen, and I'll never forget that match.

I also loved your time with VG, and I'll always think they'd have gone way further if they had stayed with you.

I hope to see you soon on a great team, one that works so hard as you work on yourself. Perhaps a return to Europe wouldn't be bad.

As always, cheers and a great hug from your biggest Brazilian fan.",2020-03-31 13:21:41

9889,fm0ou8c,comment,1585663113.0,10,"It's a nice post but I always felt like Black\^ is a tunnel vision player, kind of like Pajkatt. These kinds of players only shine if their teams create a certain scenario for them. At the highest level of DotA, you need to be adaptable, and all five players need to apply constant pressure on the enemy team. I've never had the sense that teams feel any pressure from Black\^ playing against him; he plays like he has a plan to win the game in a certain way, and all you need to do is throw a monkey wrench in that plan and the teams he's been on will fall apart.

Maybe this isn't an accurate impression. I wonder what other spectators think.

I guess, not that my impression is likely to be meaningful, I would suggest to Black\^ to ""Play to Slay"" as opposed to ""Play to Win."" The best defense is offense! We haven't had a patch suited to an ""Art of War"" approach to DotA for many years now.",2020-03-31 13:58:33

2. I'm mid at that game so why will i pick anything that will synergizes with a sniper pos 4? I prefer countering their pick. But why will a mid player pick a hero that will have a good coordination with a sniper support? And tell me what should you pick with sniper support? Before that game I played with a sniper support which give us a hard time here is the match ID if you don't believe me 5324958882. So I post it here to ask where the fuck this meta came from?
3. Me constantly flaming him? I didn't talk the whole game but this sniper have the nerve to blame me who keeps on killing their motherfucking enemy cores instead of blaming void who's first item is mkb against hero who doesn't have evasion, they don't even have bfly or halberd. This sniper is a walking food for morph and clockwerk.  Sniper needs agha to have a stun so that means  I need to wait for his agha for him to be effective in clash? His sharpnel is nonsense against morph and jugg. I need to clarify that I'm pertaining to void when I mentioned on my post ""account buyer"". Because he really dont know that mkb is only great for heroes with evasion.
4. Game ended.
5. I posted it on reddit because I beg the enemy to help us report void and the response is ""EZ MID"" then this sniper flame me. I want to tell dota players in reddit that if they don't help another team for reporting their cancer teammates valve's effort to create a better matchmaking will never be perfect because they tolerate people like this.

Out of the entire first page I looked at all your losses, there is exactly 2 losses against a huskar, best part is that huskar was 4/5 in KDA in both those games.

There is also 1 loss against a meepo who stomped you because you had garbage heroes against it and the fact he has over 1k games makes me safe to say he isn't smurfing.


There is only 1 games of your entire front page of losses where I could agree you got smurfed out off and that is against a broodmother with a 76% winrate in 100 games.

Also, there are many smurfs that are not taking the game seriously, also, with a low behaviour score smurfs are having a harder time to climb (those are the type of people who either got banned or dropped low enough in BS to simply make a new account because it's easier and then dropped again). Also, smurfs are not only on the enemy team and they are also on mine, but plenty of smurfs are like ""you don't deserve to win so I will throw"". You know, there are smurfs who are treating their smurfs as a hobby because they got ranked anxiety on their mains.

Games:

My last game, smurf/booster MK destroyed mid and destroyed the game after, anon so you couldn't tell anyway.

My 2nd last game: PA played too well, destroyed the game, anon so you couldn't tell anyway.

My 3rd last game: nobody but Mars was suspicious.

My 4th last: Alch smurf/boost in a party

My 5th: low tier 5 party stack game

My 6th game: My team had a smurf Lycan

My 7th: smurf MK who decided to lose on purpose because he didn't like Huskar

My 8th: Meepo smurf who actually won mid against MK

My 9th: possible MK smurf who destroyed his items

My 10th: Naga was really good but there is something off with his winrates

My 11th: Both MK and Mag are the same as Naga, played too well for my bracket but their winrates are all over the place (all 3 have 1k games)

My 12th: That MK I mentioned above played Meepo and rolled over us (our pick was not as bad you think)

My 13th: SF was really good, destroyed Huskar mid somehow

My 14th: Timber was really good

My 15th: Timber was once again really good

My 16th: Huskar made Mag abandon after destroying him in the lane

My 18th had Void smurf (mentioned above, same dude)

And I cant bother doing more but my 17th game was a fun one

Morph smurf, WK smurf, Grandma smurf, WW smurf, ET smurf

Many smurfs go under the radar because their profiles are hidden or because they may not be 7 to 9k smurfs but 6k or something so their consistency against Divine players isn't as good but as long as they are 1 to 1.5k above Divines, they simply just play that much better, can be considered smurfs even with 1k games btw.",2020-03-31 13:47:37

10086,fm0qbwb,comment,1585664029.0,-1,"So because they are anon you automatically assume they are not a smurf? You do understand that more smurfs keep their profiles hidden because they want to hide shit?

Also, I mentioned that every other game, not every game so PA and Mars are still within what I said even if they turn out just to be good players (rofl).

That MK is definitely a smurf, if he threw in my game because he did not like someone does not mean that he has never done it before which would explain his winrate with 500 games.

My peak was 5.2k and those games are in like 4.8k bracket, I can tell who is playing way better than they should be playing in a bracket like that. That PA for an example played really well and I also played really well (gave him all the space with my SF if you paid attention), not to mention I was against Kunkka smurf on mid (forgot to mention this guy until you brought up this game with PA but I could tell he was a smurf even before I looked at his DB) so I can even win lanes or games against smurfs but I simply don't like losing games to smurfs who are cheesing me with this change.

Another thing that could explain those win-rates is that many people like to buy low tier accounts that got ranked unlocked and then boost them themselves (they save about 200 bucks this way), not to mention this is all at like 2-3k behaviour score, those smurfs are there for a reason and it surely is not because they are like other smurfs, carrying their games quietly.",2020-03-31 14:13:49

10162,fm7xcf9,comment,1585838698.0,1,">Even many pros focus on 3rd skill

Yes; CM's whole design makes her aura the default slash logical go-to choice to max first in order to sustain the use of her abilities, since they cost plenty mana to cast for containing a good amount of disable -- plus one of which is on short cooldown -- and that the hero doesn't get that much stats either innately or from the item you normally would build on her.

Since 7.23 cranked up the skirmish/brawling aspect of many, especially with the introduction of Void Spirit and Snapfire; I've been thinking CM as someone you thought you would want to pick for supplying additional mana in the current meta, however nearly every (if not all) trending pick could leverage on her weak attributes as well as how she works, or penalize the low individual impact of hers for maxing aura first and just outright squash her.

&#x200B;

I guess CM still has an unique niche for providing a mana aura globally, but that concept is quite outdated, especially when comparing the efficiency between the aura's early potency versus Clarity that has seen ever wider use in the last year or so.",2020-04-02 14:44:58

Ie, someone tilting because your offlaner picked off-meta pick, and choosing to focus on a fact of the past [My offlaners bad pick] instead of being more mindful, and focusing on the future of the game [What can we do with his pick]. 

There are some fundamental realisations I think I've come across that I think is necessary to understand in order to be able to deal with the frustrating nature of DotA.

So, it would be very helpful to hear some reflections or experiences from others, to better understand how toxicity/frustration in DotA is perceived by others than myself.",2020-03-31 09:28:09

I can give you an example from my quarantined weeks of gaming: I've gained roughly 1000 mmr (82% win rate since March 13th, 340 games). 
In many of games there's been a real high tilt% danger from teammates because of a rough laning stage, and I've realized that just telling a person that is starting to lose it that I think their frustration is understandble (because laning was rough) but that we should try to look for a fix(the future of the game), not talk about a problem we can't change(the past of the game) has had way more success than I think any person might think it will have.

Acknowledgment and de-escalation is key, but very hard to do in an environment such as DotA's, because it's very intense and high pace. But I think it's without a doubt doable.",2020-03-31 12:23:18

You have 2 options. One is attempting to calm your ally down and the other is to just ignore him.

The easiest option is to just ignore him. Mute, and pretend he's paid by the enemy to lose.

The other much more difficult option is to calm the tilter down. Merely typing ""don't tilt"" will not work. You need to use a mic here. Try to make it look like you can win the game. Many people will actually try if they realise a game is winnable.

Edit: I literally passed this post while queuing and then this miserable shit happened to me, glad I have to wait another hour to que after the 30 minutes it took to boot up, crash, restart, spectate, and then que for a black screen.

10257,fm01su0,comment,1585641380.0,49,"Some reasons I can think of:

* Public game data not enabled
* Games not recorded while Steam was down (though usually they get parsed eventually)
* Event game modes (think Siltbreaker) being played shortly after release and sites not parsing them properly
* Game modes (like co-op with bots) being counted depends on the site used

The correct figure is probably the in-game one.",2020-03-31 07:56:20

Stratz is using Turbo matches for stats, so that's probably why you got 160 here.

I'm not exactly sure about OpenDota. It may be using stats from pub, battle pass and competitive lobbies, but I'm not sure about extra 2 matches. It may be affected by co-op bot matches (or maybe event matches, like year beast or the last one).",2020-03-31 12:52:37

10267,fm1g4io,comment,1585677790.0,0,"* I have public game data enabled.
* Could be that certain games were not recorded, but there is a function on each of these sites to refresh your account and match history to include any missed matches which I did, so likely not this.
* Certain game modes like this definitely don't count on certain sites, but afaik, Phoenix was not enabled to be picked in Siltbreaker, which is the only holiday/battle pass game mode I really played (the hero is too OP in most of these modes).
* Haven't played co-op with bots ever but I'm guessing turbo doesn't get counted on some of these sites (again just a guess).

10402,fm0rm23,comment,1585664779.0,0,"I dont think you understand the true power behind the nullifier change.

Nullifier's uniqueness was that it prevented people from using items. That support couldn't use his ghost scepter / glimmer / force staff to escape before, **BUT** his allies could. With the new change, him and his allies can't force staff / ethereal blade / glimmer the target you're nullifying because he's constantly getting dispelled. And yes, force staff is dispellable.

This item is a MUCH better general pickup, because now the item is stronger. The only drawback is that the enemy carry has ways of dealing with it, such as a manta and bkb, however, that's just the carry. Majority of the time, you want to be jumping on top of the supports anyway, the wyverns, the oracles, the snapfires, etc. This item is much stronger now because it makes the support helpless, both when you jump on the support, and when you're jumping on the support's carry, not allowing him to glimmer / force said carry out.

As for how you deal with the carry (30+ minutes, when he actually has that bkb) - it shouldve been addressed in drafting. Dont shit talk an item for your team's lack of stuns.",2020-03-31 14:26:19

So many red flags about this. FATA as captain was exactly the glue that these players needed. Handsken and Limmp while great players have never had any real success prior to this Alliance line-up. Without a strong captain I'm not sure they can really play to their potential.



Now there's strong rumors of s4 joining the team. While he is undoubtedly as experienced as FATA and definitely a better mechanical player the real question is if he is the kind of captain that can hold this team together? There's no doubt about him being a good captain, but the current Alliance is a very diverse group that might require a direct and aggressive leadership style where s4 is very subtle. We know for a fact Handsken likes to call the shots as well so I really hope he can fall in line. There's also the question on what position s4 would play. Captaining from the offlane can be strenuous, and a role switch to 5 would make this a first in competitive Dota for him.



There's also the circumstances to consider. Alliance up to this point was all but confirmed as qualified to Ti10. They hold #6 in the rankings while playing in the, by far, most competitive region. While there's definitely a step up to teams like Secret and VG, Alliance has stayed very consistent over so far this season. While I can appreciate the ambition to really shoot for the top I'm not sure if this has gone into the territory of being greedy. I'm really hoping that Loda is operating on some inside knowledge on how the rest of the DPC season is going to turn out (and if there's going to be a Ti).



Who knows, I might be completely off. At the start of the season I thought the newly revealed Alliance line-up looked extremely questionable and I was delightfully surprised when they proved me wrong.",2020-03-31 10:26:46

https://www.expressen.se/sport/e-sport/har-varit-splittrade-under-en-langre-tid/


""Has been fragmented for a long time""

Today the shock message came that Neta ""33"" Shapira and Adrian ""Fata"" Trinks will be fired by the Swedish big team Alliance.
Now CEO Jonathan ""Loda"" Berg tells us the reason behind it.
- The group has been a bit divided for a long time, he tells SportExpressen.

In October, the Swedish Dota 2 organization Alliance released its entire team and acquired a whole new fifth consisting of Nikobaby, Limmp, Glove, 33 and Fata. Now the organization has confirmed that the latter two are forced to leave.
The message came as a shock after the team has impressed for their short time together and are close to qualifying for the giant international The International, held in Stockholm at the end of the summer.
Now the CEO and co-founder Jonathan ""Loda"" Berg explains why the players are allowed to leave.
- The group has been a bit divided for a long time. Not that there has been any major crack, but more that it has been quite clear that they want to work in different ways. It was something we discovered quite early on, but we have worked around it in different ways and changed our training to make it work, he says.
""Many were quite surprised""
The split should have become more and more evident the longer the season went on.
- I, who have played myself, see a great deal of importance in having a balance in the team and team dynamics. As a player I think everyone is cruel, there is nothing to complain about there. But in group dynamics it doesn't work out to a hundred percent, so this was the most natural.

- When we had a very good year in 2013, we were in a similar situation where we had good results, but replaced a player. Many were quite surprised, but then the reason was that the player pulled in a different direction than the others.
Alliance is expected to announce two new players shortly, but Loda is yet to comment on the details.
He admits that it involves risks to change the team in the middle of the current season, and so close to The International. At the same time, he does not want to be controlled by the giant tournament - where the winning team last year took home SEK 150 million.
- It is clear that it is risky, TI is such a big deal, but you should never be locked out of that. Based on last year's points we would have already qualified for TI now, but at the same time you never know and something extreme could have happened there as well. But I think it's important not to let TI take up too much space. Sometimes you know that you should make changes.
Were the other three in the team on this roster change?
- Yes of course. We never make changes without it being based on the team and what they want, says Loda.",2020-03-31 20:57:06

Potentially Loda wants to draft again. If thats the case it's a shame he wasn't given more time to adapt as a 5.

I always thought 33 was a bit throwy when they weren't drafting around him, and the team obv wants to constantly be drafting around Niko. I do think he's a really good offlaner, just maybe not for this team. If it's S4 that's replacing him, then I guess they want their offlane to be more of a playmaker.",2020-03-31 11:50:19

Good picks?: s4 or MC for offlane/carry (limmp or niko goes offlane); Misery or insania (backstabs long time friends? FLY 2.0?) 5th cap. Lest be honest, I kinda doubt any of them want to join Alliance, but who knows.

whatever pick: Boxi for offlane; ?Chessie and Zfreek leave OG seed and join Alliance? or someone else from OG.Seed...

Other suggestions, but kinda doubt it: Ace (maybe he can play role 3), Biver, EGM, Era, jonassomfan, Pajkatt.

'Meh' doesn't mean bad, no matter how eager you people are to put words in my mouth. It means they are mediocre compared to the rest of the teams they compete with. Whenever Alliance faced the tier 1 teams, they generally got stomped. It was rarely ever close. I should know, I literally watched all their games as a fan. No top brand team is fine with being middle of the pack.  

It's honestly hilarious how TNC gets shit on 24/7 for their recent poor form, despite actually *winning* a Major and beating tier 1 teams, while Alliance, who got one decent placement but never actually posed a threat to the tier 1 teams was somehow up there with the best.",2020-03-31 14:40:49

Yes, hesitation is only human, but the best pos5 players trust their gut and inevitably are in the right place at the right time.

The best pos 5 players seem like they have some intrinsic knowledge of where they should be. Fata looked like he was making the right plays in games against lower tier teams because there's more leeway, but in games against good teams his rotations were off and it made him look like a weak link, and for Alliance I'm sure their goal is to win against better teams, not to be known for stomping t2 teams and getting stomped by t1 teams.

Hell, let's even forget about how the Nigma series played out. They won. Great, Alliance at the Minor. Bit weird that the 4th place Major team didn't qualify directly, but guess NiP just too good. And then they got whomped by Aster, who last I checked isn't even the best team in China right now. If Alliance were truly of the quality this sub seems to believe they were, they would have had little trouble qualifying for the Major.

As I said before, Alliance had one good Major run with a bracket where they didn't have to face any of the tier 1 teams, and to their credit, they took full advantage of it.

I think that mentality is fundamentally flawed tbh, it's become pretty clear through players like Ceb and N0tail that age or time in the scene doesn't necessarily mean they've missed some sort of window. I mean, Ceb was pretty much completely out of the Dota pro scene for years and OG looked iffy as hell when he played pos 1/2. But then he won two TI's in a row. 

My point is, I don't think slumps and age are that big of an issue in esports as opposed to traditional sports, where a you literally have a physical window and peak you need to hit and then it's gone.",2020-03-31 14:02:27

10876,fm0u36p,comment,1585666189.0,1,"No, ceb is more so an exception than anything. There is literally no other player in dota history to have an even similar story to him, ao obviously an outlier not the norm. I don't think age is relevant either, couldn't care less if he was 40 or 19, but you cannot call one whole season, multiple lans, qualifiers including TI a slump. A slump that lasts for 9 months is not a slump, put rather a decline. That's not to say he can't come back and be better than ever, just that it's highly unlikely. Last season he was doing shit that has nothing to do with macro play, it was shit like dying in lane to a gank on doom and then tping right back as a solo hero into a tower being hit by 4 people and dying immediately again. That's not miscommunication nor is it a different take on tactics, it's just bad, absent-minded plays, and his last season was full of them.",2020-03-31 14:49:49

You don't even need to look further than Ceb's team. Do you think people thought N0tail was a top player between his Secret and OG days? You know, when he played for C9 and they looked like a tier 2/3 team? I bet you most people watching thought like you do now, that his career was over after the Fnatic/Secret days. It's easy to forget, but N0tail played for C9 for basically an entire season, much like S4's last year. Except N0tail with C9 got a worse finish at TI than S4 with EG, and it's not like N0tail looked flawless and his team dragged him down. 

There are others which have had the same development. It's not as rare as you might think. Now do I think S4 is a top player in the pro scene right now? Not at all, but I don't think it's a given that he's completely out of the game either.

I know you won't watch or read any of this because people who like to think they're stuck because of their team refuse to believe anything else, so I'll TL;DR it for you. You are not stuck. It is not your team holding you back. For every Luna rushing brown boots-aghs, and Pugna buying e-blade, your enemy will also have the same. If you're in the ""trench"" where your team is holding you back, your enemy is also in that exact same ""trench"" holding them back. The only consistent variable in all your games, is YOU. You affect every single one of your games, and for as long as you stay under the belief that your team is holding you back, you will only hold yourself back. If you have more impact as a mid, great, that's fantastic, that means that, shockingly, your skill as a mid is higher than your skill as a support. If you can climb as a mid, you are a better mid. You aren't stuck, you're refusing to learn from your mistakes, you're refusing to open opportunity for yourself and your team, you're refusing to take responsibility for your own impact in the game, and instead are throwing it onto other people because it's more convenient to you. Stop using the ""trench"" as a crutch, because if you do, you will never learn or grow as a player. You will only ever abuse what is meta, what has a statistical increased chance to win you the game, and you will never actually be a good DotA player.",2020-04-01 03:06:03

11039,fm44e8f,comment,1585746218.0,1,"It's not about trying to be a dick. It's about trying to hammer out the ""trench"" mentality, because you will always be held back for as long as you play thinking it's your team. It's not being a dick, it's being realistic, it's about not being babied, and it's about bettering yourself as a player. If you can climb better at a different role, you are straight up better at that role. You're able to see your mistakes better, you're able to learn quicker, and you are just better at that role. You have to take some serious considerations at your own game play, not theirs, when you can't climb. Are you stacking at the right times? Are you warding in the right places to prevent ganks or to supplement your own? Are you pulling intelligently and not mindlessly because ""pulling is good""? You are the one holding yourself back. Drop the mentality that it is your team, because it never has been and never will be. You are the one that is in every single one of your own games. You have influence over every victory. You need to watch your mistakes, learn from them, and get better. Saying your team is holding you back is also saying they should be the one's carrying you and they have 0 obligations to do so. You need to take responsibility and figure out what it is you are doing wrong to climb. It's no ones job to gain you mmr but your own",2020-04-01 13:03:38

If you're suffering in ranked I advise just not playing it. It's not worth losing your mind over videogame points. If it's straight up dota take a break, play other stuff. Mount and blade bannerlord just came out. Avoid pvp games.

I've had my fair share of burnouts from (x) game. My fresh mind vs. burnt out mind has a vast difference. So just leave for a bit- take a break. Return fresh. You'll enjoy the game again, that will make you play better, in turn enjoy the game more.

It may sound very cliche but PSA is so important! If you can’t see yourself staying in a good mental attitude while playing then step away from the game for a little. When you’re in a game and if you’re trying to lead your team and their is someone being toxic, mute them! Right away! It will save your sanity and keep the whole team from tilting. Also as much as I’m sure you don’t want to hear it... you’re in the bracket because that’s your skill level most likely... I’ve been in the 4K bracket for a while now.

Basic psychology here, if your teammates are bad that means in some games your enemies are as bad too.

But for you to judge them as ""bad"" means that you assume that you are ""better"" than them. 

So you're problem here is not your opponents being better. It's your teammates being bad. So you do what every ""better"" player does...Carry them.

But wait...how can you carry them if they are bad and wont support you or create space for you?

This is the trench, Jerax wont tiny roam and destroy lanes for you. so either mid and own or jungle and get your items. You shouldn't depend on your teammates.

If you're better you will climb up. If you wont climb..well keep trying.",2020-03-31 09:44:39

11137,fm04570,comment,1585643966.0,1,"Mandatory copy and pasted from my library of things to say.

There are only a few ten thousand immortal players. How did they get there?

Did they get lucky? Did they get boosted (some of them did)? Or did they just get good?

In Dota, you will be exactly where you belong. You may think that you are higher, but this is completely false. Your skill level is what dictates your mmr, not your teammates. Because as your teammates are bad, so will be the enemy.

Think of it like this. Your team are constants. Your enemy are constants. But you are a variable, and you can change the outcome of the game.

Dota is a complex game. There are things a 5k player will pick up which a 1k won't. This is because of the difference in their understanding of the game. Understanding the game and applying these concepts will make you way better compared to everyone else, that there is little way that you lose. You may have thought that you were the highest impact, but this could be a completely wrong analysis of the game.

As a low immortal who smurfs a lot in Ancient, I see your mistakes. But that doesn't bring me down, because I understand that if I just do better than my counterpart, I am very likely to win the game. Even if you throw, I will catch the game. Or I will just destroy so hard, it is almost impossible to throw the game.

Your attitude is very bad for climbing. Even in a losing game where my ta sells items, I learn something. Every loss, I try to learn something. I stop making that mistake, and I gain mmr. That is the best way to climb in Dota. Learning. Learn more, gain more.

The trench exists. But its easier to get out of than you think.

TL;DR, Stop complaining, start learning.",2020-03-31 08:39:26

You need to understand that your MMR is an indication of how good you are at climbing, not how good you are at the game. The toxicity of our community shouldn't distract you from that fact. I'm sorry that social/status pressure is fucking you up this bad, but it's also your fault for letting it.

If nothing works, just don't do your placements next season. Stop putting that opus of ""having to climb"" on yourself if it's all you see. There'll never be a respectable rank. People call N0tail trash. **You just have to respect yourself.**

Unexpectedly got into a Random Draft game as the offlaner (it's right fricken there in the dotabuff, jackass).  Up until then I had been playing a lot of pos4-5 and basically had only practiced WR in offlane who was unavailable.  So getting a less familiar role on a limited selection meant I had to do some quick thinking and I figured sprout could ground target against rage/brewmaster earth bear.  Made it very clear to my team from the get go that I was uncomfortable on this hero/position, but played it out anyway.  Basically the first game I had ever attempted to use treants to harass pos5 and block pulls so I was figuring things out on the fly.

Since I don't play the hero, I was very unsure what items to get.  My brain figured we were doing well, Specter is the past has been a late game hero that farms jungle with radiance so the Midas would give me farm that wasn't necessarily available on the map.  Guide recommended orchid.  Being a slave to guides has ruined me in the past so I decided to think on my own and felt a hurricane like could outrange/push me away after getting hit by their slows.  Admittedly, did not connect that I could prevent Naix from raging with Orchid and since I never play the hero I'm unused to seeing him as the flash farmer he is (his party member was definitely telling him items anyway).  Thought I had time and by the time I realized he was a problem I went straight for Sheep stick which was too ambitious but whatever.

I was rated the second lowest MMR on my team and the lowest that wasn't partying with another teammate so I feel I well played beyond expectation.

But in a serious note, lack of harass. I play aggressive offlaners and need a good start in lane. So when I'm getting right clicked constantly by their support, I want my support to throw some right clicks back.

My ideal POS 4 wards behind their t1, contests their pulls, Snipes couriers, and basically just chases the other support around, leaving me with a winnable 1v1 against their safelaner.

The next level POS 4 goes out and double waves the creeps for me when I'm laning against a hard counter (slark vs timber).

I highly suggest playing some POS 3, I believe the two roles to be similar and much more intertwined than the 5 and 1. You are both playing the same lane, with the same objective, fuck up the enemy safelaner. Only difference is which one of you gets the gold.

Out of the many horrible things that happen to offlaners, 2 things tilt me the hardest:

1. Supports that make no effort to touch the enemy safelaner or enemy pulls whatsoever. One of the key goals of offlane is to prevent the enemy carry from having a free game. In today's 2v2 laning meta, a support that does nothing to help this and instead plays like a babysitter is just an exp sponge and will definitely leave me extremely behind and vulnerable when he eventually leaves the lane to roam.

2. Juggernaut. Between his faster-than-you base attack time,  free magic immunity, 500 damage nuke, get out of jail free card in healing ward and extreme threat to me the moment he reaches level 6, this is the matchup I find least fair in the safelane v offlane meta. His ubiquity is a very strong part of why i'm a brew spammer- the ms burst you get from drunken brawler allows you to zip out of blade fury range, and you can waste his ult easily with brew split.",2020-03-31 05:14:02

As a pos4, if the lineup is 212 then all you have to do them harass the enemy safelane into insanity. To a point where they can’t even show themselves and the carry gets fed up and farm in the jungle. Also don’t be afraid to trade lives.

One thing I didn't see mentioned by the others. If there is large creep wave coming towards our tower due to me creep managing well or us beating their pulls or similar, you can help your offlaner a lot by stepping out of xp range. Go stack jungle camps or stop them from creep pulling and come back when the wave is pushed again. I get a lot of xp, which most offlane heroes like even more than gold, and can often get ahead of the enemy core in xp.  

This makes the lane waaay easier when you eventually leave to go help other lanes. I can get a fast 6 which changes everything for heroes like pango, clock etc. and I can contribute way more if they dive our safelaner tower and I tp there to help, or maybe I can even solo kill their core.  

This was mentioned in a cast by Capitalist (who also plays a lot of offlane) once and I just can't forget it.

11232,fm03xxj,comment,1585643740.0,3,"While I appreciate your question in the title, because it is worded as if I were in therapy, I will try to make a list of positive things for a 4 to do. Comprehensive list as a 5k offlaner main:

1) When you die, ask your offlaner for his items to bring with you back to the lane. Add an extra salve if you can spare the gold, playing aggressively is the bread and butter of most offlane players.

2) By default pick a ranged hero, unless your offlaner shows a ranged hero, then you can pick a melee. If you pick a melee, you are forcing your offlaner to either pick a ranged, which in most cases means that your offlaner is not gonna do his job correctly (initiation, aura carrying, crowd control) or pick a melee and 2 melee offlane almost never works, because it is trivial to counter and is basically a freeloss, because there's so many meta-carries right now that crush melee lanes. So instead of slowing down their carry, you accelerate his farm, which is basically griefing.

3) Learn when to pull the hardcamp and when to play with your offlaner. Typically in my successful games it looks like this: we establish dominance over the course of 2-4 levels, when I'm beefy enough to stand my ground and still prevent the farm of the carry, I expect my 4 to start pulling the hardcamp (which was previously stacked, ideally). Basically - when you are stronger than their lane play with your offlaner to own them, if you are weaker try laning shenanigans, if your offlaner is so strong he can be left solo, either pull the hard camp or roam to other lanes. Always ask if he is strong enough. 

4) Let him buy the ward in strategy time, if he doesn't do it, you do it, but let him have the chance to place that ward. He knows how he wants the lane to play out, since he picked his hero after you, so let him establish appropriate vision. 

5) If your offlaner got countered by their carry, play with him, not away from him. The pos 5 will try to lure you into a 1v1 somewhere in the middle of nowhere, don't let that happen. Play with your offlaner. With the new pick phase it almost never happens that the offlane hero can 1v1 the safelane, unless someone fucked up the draft royally. 

6) Before going away for whatever reason, always provide vision if your offlaner is ahead, because it is trivial for him to get ganked and lose any advantage he might have accrued. 

7) If in doubt, play with your offlaner.",2020-03-31 08:35:40
11233,flzsian,comment,1585632206.0,2,"Depending on bracket things change, but its really hard to tilt an offlane player as their role is suposed to deal with all  the bullshit , however there are some things:


1-Support not playing agressively enough as mentioned by someone else in here(If i have to Go base and my Sup is Full Hp that's though)


2-Support not understanding the Lane:If you have to babysit me until i get a certain level and you Just leave before me that would probably annoy me but not tilt.


3-I can't stress this enough but If you are going to leave the offlane to gank someone warn me First If we were playing agressive


4-If you are abandoning the Lane to help a mid or safelane who is strugling If you be so kind as to ward before you leave we Will Love you forever


5- Talk to us!!!This is the most important thing...we need to agree on how we want to Lane,whats the ideal scenario and If that doesnt happen what can we do(This is not you telling him what to do but discussing It together).But there is a tricky part  to this as we Don't really want to Talk more then we have to.
Comunication is Key on dota,but on offlane is more important as things happen faster and more often.

11234,flzykxh,comment,1585637939.0,1,"I don't play offlane that much but you are right, your lane mate will make or break the lane. One thing I like to see is heroes like shaman or rubick getting their dmg spells going and whittling down the safelane's regen and their confidence when they try to get a last hit. If you're a shaman diving in for another shackle attempt after the first 3 cost me all my tangos and a bunch of cs I'll just pretend you aren't there. 

The biggest thing I don't like is when the pos 4 doesn't know when they need to stay or leave the lane. My goal as an offlane is generally to get enough early farm that I have the sustain to farm and push lanes so I can take the other team's t1 neutrals and possibly tower. If I'm a centaur with boots, wand, and ring and I'm farming the waves and camps with ease and you're standing beside me the whole time because we can't get an easy kill, then you need to stop leaching exp and find someone that you can enable to get kills. If I'm stuck farming my own jungle and only fighting creep waves under my tower than you need to get back here and help salvage the lane. 

Another thing that's easy to point out are the players who only know how to play a certain hero one way with no variation ever. If you are the pos 3 you need to get away from them asap. I mostly pick support with heroes like ogre and witch doctor who can level up their spells in any order depending on needs. I'm sure you've seen the level 1 pudge hook, techies suicide, potm arrow, afk roaming spirit breakers whose only play is to repeatedly spam the same 1 in 100 play that hasn't worked out yet and now he's pinging the t1 tower as he dives a lvl 11 huskar with his lvl 7 spirit breaker.",2020-03-31 06:58:59

11249,fm064wx,comment,1585646237.0,1,"I end up prefering solo lanes because usually a combination of the following happens.

• Trying to contest my cs. This tilts me the most. The best lanes are the ones where the support helps double deny and secure cs that I am missing anyway. I don't particularly mind if the only CS they're stealing from me are by using spells to secure the ranged creeps.

• Standing behind me and not harassing but only reacting to enemy aggression, which typically doesn't help. Harass at least one enemy. This typically also means they share exp for every creep that dies, and I will die a couple times due to their aggression and the lack of ours and the support then gets solo exp while I'm waiting to respawn. A support with fewer deaths than me and more exp than me is very tilting. 

• Nuking the wave and constantly pushing it (ex: a KOTL constantly blasting the wave) 

• EXP! Give me exp. If the wave is under my tower, get out of exp range so I can get the exp. If you are not constantly standing behind me, chances are I'm getting solo exp for a few creeps at least. 

• Contest enemy pulls and pull yourself! The number of times the enemy support is pulling and nothing being done about it is too damn high. Either go contest the pull, or go aggressive on the carry. Put the 2 v 1 to an advantageous use. In hard lanes, cutting and bringing the wave to a safer position (absolutely not just pulling into the small camp - highly tilting!) or doing the hard camp pull.

• Know when to leave the lane. Sometimes, our lane duo simply has no kill potential. Ensure I get lvl 3 before their enemy carry and leave. The solo exp matters a lot in hard lanes, and if you leave to help other lanes you're helping the team

• Creep aggro and tanking them. It is so annoying when supports in the name of harassing enemies constantly draw aggro and ruin the positioning. Sometimes they're going for a kill but conveniently ignore 3 melee & 2 ranged creeps hitting them and then gift a kill to the enemy carry. 

• If you've left the offlane, doesn't mean you can't teleport in to help him and turn around a fight. The number of times I get ""you wanted solo lane"" when I ask supports to help me. Understand power spikes. If I have a power spike advanatge over the carry, teleport in to secure a kill!

I would also understand if they just want to get one level and leave but some of them just chill behind me forever or and as soon as the lane is pushed he just fucks off to other lanes. they could've just simply do a pull if the lane is pushed or if we are super weak they can just do an offlane pull for me and fix my lane instead of running around the map being useless, then i wouldn't even mind that very much to share that exp of the wave with them but the motherfuckers simply start in safelane whenever the matchup is bad like against ursa or razor usually and after u fix the lane as the offlaner on your own and finally get a free double wave under your tower the pos4 immediately starts tping to your lane :) and he does it in the enemys vision too :) if this is not the scummiest thing to do i don't know what is :)These goons don't understand that if i get a exp lead just by being solo i can start ganking mid or other lanes faster, i might even 2v1 my own lane after level 5 but no fucking come over and share exp u useless pigeon that's my game done right there..

And even in case of a normal 2v2 there are a lot of laning mistakes coming from pos4s that tilts me as an offlaner,i consider the pos4 role to be the 2nd hardest in the game after pos2 and the offlane imo is the 2nd easiest in the game...in my experience pos4s in my pubs are either simply gods who win you the early game  mostly thro map awareness and on point rotations or they are simply useless peons that their team would've won/lost without them regardless of their existence. it's really hard to be a good pos4 imo but basically in a normal 2v2 lane try to understand whos stronger and how to deal with it if the oppnent are stronger, if u have no clue simply ask from or listen to your offlaner and u can get a lot of things straight during the first minute and a half before the laning begins",2020-03-31 12:29:09

Too often position 4's try going way too aggressive and try to get me to commit to kills. I'd rather they just harass and help zone out the enemy instead unless we can get an easy kill.

The other thing are the 4 positions who just sit around in lane soaking XP. If you're not actively helping protect me or zone the enemy then *go do something else*. Go pull, go stack, anything.

2. Not contesting 5min runes.

3. Getting to the longer point of harass. There are cases where I can effectively zone the safelaner by myself like when I'm playing underlord, in this case I mostly need the pos 4 to fight the enemy support so that I can continue zoning the enemy carry without being killed in return.

Other times, the enemy support may not be aggressive in which, you are better off helping either other lanes or further zoning the carry.

Let me get some early levels please. You can like get xp to reach level 2 because most supports need a second skill ( like telekinesis on rubick, shield/blast on lich or something ) beyond this, offlane heroes are usually stronger early game fighters and I therefore need xp to win the lane.

11305,fm0olcx,comment,1585662958.0,0,"Thank you for trying to get better, here's the two super-tilting things/tips how to play Pos 4 better from an offlaner:

* **Don't trilane/roam unless the enemy carry is totally out of the game (at least 2 levels below the offlaner)** \- in most games in 2020, trilaning or roaming is simply going to be straight up bad, and will lead to the enemy carry free farming, your job is to help me win the lane and mess the enemy carries life up, this is how I think about it and this is how you should think about it too - no offlaner wants to farm-trade with the enemy carry or farm the jungle, I would rather have less myself and totally gimp the enemy carry. If mid/safelane is losing that's not good, but the way lanes work these days it is much much easier (and very normal in certain lanes) for the carry/mid to jungle. **If you let the enemy carry freefarm, he will be massive and your pos 3 will be useless the entire game.**
* **Don't play passive on the lane** \- your job is to support me, you should be spamming your spells on the enemy off CD (where it makes sense ofc), and generally playing sacrificially - probably the most tilting thing to play with is pudge pos 4 that just stand in the trees trying to hook, while I am soaking damage from the enemy pos 5 and 1, just run at them with rot on, it's honestly better.

Honestly I could write more, but in 99.999% of my games the pos 4 commits one of the above fatal lane-losing errors, please please please focus on almost never doing either of those, you will win a lot more lanes if you don't and you will make your offlaner's life a lot happier.",2020-03-31 13:55:58

You hit like a firetruck, have a nice animation and your base regen got buffed, sure your armour is low, but you just have to play it like treant, deny all you can, harass when they overextend.

Rot and oov stack additively, i usually start wind lace but get oov at about when i hit level 3, then you get a 33% slow and 60dps + your attacks. Maybe you die because you're rotting yourself to death as well, but as long as their carry dies first it's fine.

With a ward to scout pulls most supports stand stock still while they hit the easy camp, or at least move predictably, so get the hook on them, take them away from their carry, and kill them with the 33% slow.

1. Rubick instapicks despite being offlane  
2. CM doesn't want to pick \[ picks 3rd\]  
3. I pick BH 2nd \[ My fault maybe I didn't notice rubick should be core\].

4. Rubick cant core BH, I am not a core player but I agree since he is not confident at all

5. Started well, killed tiny and wasn't letting jugg farm was fairly aggressive, pugna hits lvl 6  and ganks the hell out of us. Also, note Ember is not calling missing since he is destroying mid.

6. Rubick is not buying sentry \[ got 1 at the start\] or buying wards \[i got them still\] , there are a lot of sentries and we are getting dewarded. Their offlane is losing hard and comes top \[ 4 top with mid\] and we are constantly ganked.

7. At one point im 1-5 lvl 5, Naga is farmed, the jugg who couldn't farm is almost free farming there are 4 top and neither CM or Ember are tping top and I cant jungle because I don't have the items to do so yet. 

9. I call out CM and Ember in chat \[ aggressively my fault, but I was repeatedly asking for help I am not a core player I'm struggling with farm and I am being killed a lot and I cant jungle yet\], promptly get called a noob and flamed the whole game especially from Rubick who ass I tried to cover by going core.

10. CM starts following me in Jungle and last hits my creeps \[ I am not used to farming and I don't do crap like that in games so I had no answer to that\].

11737,flzdnhm,comment,1585621211.0,26,"""games are supposed to make you feel relaxed and fun""

only true if you enjoy the activity to the very core.

like if I only ever go rock climbing with a friend and have fun when he guide me and encouraged me. but at the core it's not really that interesting to me to climb, find new holds, new paths, then I'm not gonna enjoy and relaxed when I do it on its own.

you mentioned ""it's the only game you can play"".
ask yourself do you really enjoy dota, moving, casting, finding ways to beat enemy, working from behind, etc etc. every aspect of dota at their own rights.

or do you only enjoy 1 aspect, being the community/comradery of it.

obviously nothing can excuse toxicity and I admit it's a huge problem in dota and any online game.

but I've been playing solo for the longest time, at your bracket for a long time before I climbed.

through the times I honestly forget the games you complained about. they all just blend together. but overall I still feel like I wanna play because I just wanna do stuff in dota because it's dota, and I enjoy it, and not because I'm expecting strangers to behave a certain way.

and of course you can always find like minded play mates in various forums if you still insist.",2020-03-31 02:20:11

In the end, the flaming come backs when the enemies are about to win. 

I actually don’t get the mindset of these players. At a minimum, i expect toxic assholes to remain toxic assholes for the entire game. It’s worse when people act like they’ve mastered the game and flame others for performing like an immortal top 100. Do people not understand they’re playing together because they’re paired through MMR? I see Legend 1 players calling archon 5 players “trash archon scrubs” when they’re literally separated by like 100 mmr or so.

This is the mental attitude some the low-rank player while they think they are better than other people even on the same tea with the same rank.

Few months ago, I started playing only turbo to ease up things a bit and started working on my all-hero challenge. It gives you more freedom to try out things, learn other heroes and just let things go.

For the ranked, I would suggest that you try other heroes too. Void and Enigma always carry that burden of casting perfect ult. I would specifically suggest you to try playing pos4 heroes. Absolve yourself out of a pressure role if it is getting to your nerves.
A very good part about playing solo is that you can play any role in your next game as per your mood. Maybe 1 game you are p1 Void, next game you are p3 Underlord, next game p2 Zeus, next game p5 Dazzle. Enjoy the variety man.",2020-03-31 07:10:09

I gained hundreds of MMR, by spam UD and Doom as 3, since 7.24 till now. I have 9.8k-10k behaviour score.

Here my tips:  


\- If enemy talk in all chat -> muted all of them, even if its just friendly chat, you never know what happens later.

\- If a teammate blames/yell/rage typing, muted voice/chat them.

\- If all blames you, muted all 9 other players. Calm your mind and try to gain more focus for the game.

\- Spam strong hero only. Like I said earlier, I spam UD and Doom as 3, and went from Legend 3 (core, still a thing on 7.24) to Ancient 3. So you can know your item timing, better gameplay, etc. You can watch videos from Gameleap or Jenkins on youtube. For me, they gave me valuable information on what should I do in this patch. In this video, Speeed (Gameleap) tell 2 heroes on each lane with highest winning rate on all medal in 7.25:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6ft-jsJSl4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6ft-jsJSl4) .

11890,flyx6g1,comment,1585610925.0,3,"I don't like the Sven pick. This hero is easily countered I would recognize that the Nightstalker will be destroyed in his lane, as NS players always do by default below 6k.

You need a hero that doesn't care about getting snowballed on, and is good vs LS and WK, and can make space while your Tinker is farming and your NS does his best to not ruin the game. So I would pick a Riki - one more item and then you start killing people, can blink out of or disjoint Tusk and WK initiation.

Picking a farm intensive hero like Sven when it's not even really a great Sven game is asking to lose. CK or Morphling would be pretty good too.

Basically it's a game where your team lost by picking NS and Axe first two pick for no reason and gave away a free win. My God.",2020-03-30 23:28:45
11891,flz4ua1,comment,1585615547.0,1,"the other guy didn't actually answer your question he just called the pick bad so here's some advice

1. 151 cs in a 30 minute game on sven is pretty abysmal. I think you should prioritize farming more on that hero than fighting. The general playstyle of it is that you farm fairly fast and then you press r and you 2-3 shot everyone on their team with your item advantage. Just farm a lot and show up to fights if they're beneficial to you. If it's just your team dying to some stupid shit don't join them. 

2. skill build, go first point Q, second point E, then just save your skill points after that. You want to max cleave so you can start farming the jungle fast asap, but you don't want to skill the points during the lane cause it'll push. When you've reached the point where you can push your wave and then farm the neutral camps during the down time is when you put your points into cleave.

3. Your item build looks reasonable for the game, generally you want treads > mom > crystalis and then bkb but if you were backed into a corner and needed to fight asap then bkb after mom is ok too. You have an empty slot in your inventory, generally on strength heroes it is typical to just have a casual gloves of haste. It's a lot of attack speed for the cost so it's pretty effective. I'd recommend trying that out.",2020-03-31 00:45:47

1-6, Bans

7, first pick for A

8-9, first and second pick for B

10, second pick for A

11-14, second round of bans

15, first pick of second picking round (3rd hero for A)

And on it goes.  Not gonna list all pick numbers here.  Also of note, in the last patch captains mode bans we’re increased to 4 at the beginning I believe which changes the whole schema.

Why is this all important?  Certain heroes are better when picked in a certain phase of the draft due to how niche their counters are, or how flexible they are as a pick (able to be played in several roles/lanes if the primary role gets countered).",2020-03-30 23:22:52

If both got kicked at the same time, then the game first registered as winner the one who is in the order of players later; but in the same tick, the ""winner flag"" got overwritten by the other player. Since the winner flag was non-neutral, the game ended at the next tick.

This is probably what most non-league players are missing. The issues isn't with the champions, usually, it's with the lack of utility you have + you're basically guaranteed to be down a LOT of  xp against solo laners; if you're even something has gone horribly wrong for the enemy team.

There are plenty of games in league where I'm like 5/1 out of lane and solo die with no contest to their 1/2 toplaner or something.

I guess the real difference is that it feels like you get run down SO easily in league, when one person is on top of you, you die really quickly.

once i killed mids courier with circlet and wb recipe, then when it respawned i killed it again now with 2x circlet 2x recipes, which caused the enemy 4 to tp mid to try and kill me (he failed), then he tried to deward and missed, hes now wasted 125 gold and left his lane for 2-3 waves which took pressure off of our safe lane. the third time his courier came back he walked back to his t2 to meet the courier, causing him to miss a creep wave, and our mid won easily since his opponent didn't have his stats for like, 4 minutes

i also killed their 3s courier coming back and at the same time their 4s courier was also on the way with boots, which i also killed

that's not even accounting for the gold the courier killing gets because it's really not about that

In dota, the role goes 1 mid, 1 safelabe carry, an offlaner and 2 supports. But those roles might not really be followed in the lower beginners bracket and might not really apply to your games yet. Dont think about roles and meta rn. You should focus on learning the heroes and the items and spells to get used to the game and focus on roles and such later on when you've got a hang of the game itself.

This is pretty rich considering the original beta was friends and family (personalities) for ages with very limited public access, creating the echo chamber that still-birthed the game.

A. In the new version cards are unlocked through play. Individual cards are likely to have been changed, removed, or brand new; so old decks and stats wouldn’t be valid.

12385,flypdla,comment,1585606492.0,-5,"Hello r/Artifact! Before I get into the meat of the article, I thought I’d introduce myself. My card game experience comes from the Pokemon Trading Card Game. I started collecting and playing way back in the nineties. After nearly a decade playing casually, I ended up moving toward the competitive scene for a handful of years. I had a few big tournament wins and a lot of success playing the game. There was even a point that I was a paid writer for a Pokemon Trading Card Game website known as SixPrizes, you can see my articles here.

Within the eSports world, I have worked in the production side of things at a few major tournaments. As a Production Assistant and Camera operator, I worked at IGN Pro League 3 in Atlantic City (Here’s a picture of me and Idra), as well as IGN Pro League 5 in Las Vegas (Here’s a photo before we opened the main stage). Live eSports events are so unbelievable to witness, as a fan. Twitch is convenient, but it is just not the same. Being there, LIVE, with people who share your interest, who will shout and scream with you when your favorite team wins? There is nothing like it. You have to go to a live event for your favorite game, if you haven’t already.

The last thing about myself I’d like to cover is what drew me to Artifact. I’ve always been a fan of the RTS genre. DotA, Heroes of Newerth, League of Legends, you name it. If you played HoN, you might remember that “Too Bad it’s Me, Blacksmith” meme? Yeah, that was me. Sorry! Ha!

Truth be told, I’ve had an off-and-on relationship with all of these games. Going from riding a high of winstreaks to the inevitable burning out when paired with casual players who are playing to have fun and goof around. Who even plays games to have fun? Totally insane, right? Sheesh!

So finally, there’s Artifact, a game that I can only blame myself when I lose. One versus one in an RTS style game, based around trading cards, it’s basically the exact type of game I’ve been looking for my entire life. That’s why I’m writing this article on reddit, and that’s why I know Artifact will be the biggest eSport title, ever. Here’s ten reasons that’s going to happen --

1. Valve

Valve has such an incredible track record of PC titles. Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, Portal, Left for Dead, DotA 2, it’s actually unbelievable. And when Artifact was announced at the DotA International 7, it wasn’t received well. But that’s because those people in the crowd were just plain ignorant. (Yeah, I said it!) They were thinking Valve was piggy-backing off of Hearthstone’s success.

I guess you can’t blame them for thinking that, many developers have entered the genre of digital trading card games, but none of them have had Hearthstone’s financial success. And damn, Hearthstone has been an extremely profitable title. In the most recent Financial report from Activision Blizzard, the company was reporting that pre-orders for the Boomsday Project were exceeding any previous expansion. That’s actually off the charts, because Hearthstone has been around for over FOUR YEARS now!

But there’s a few things Hearthstone hasn’t done right, from a competitive standpoint. And now that I think about it, has Blizzard ever handled eSports correctly? If you ask me, they’ve only ever been interested in making games that are popular, which is fine, and clearly worked for them as a business model. But that doesn't translate into a competitive eSport.

But Valve though? Get out of town! They’ve been a major player in eSports for many years. Just take a look at the DotA International’s prize support! Here’s a list of the Top Games awarding prize money across all tournaments. DotA 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are the top games. But get this, after adding up ALL of the prize support between the next THIRTY games on this list, you STILL don’t exceed the total prize support from DotA 2 and CS:GO. That’s BONKERS!

I know what you’re going to say, and I agree, prize support isn’t everything. But it’s definitely a massive part of a game’s success (And by extension, the developer of that game). Think about all the people involved when a game is successful, other than players. Production crew at live events (I was one of those guys!), camera crews, media companies, eSports organizations, even a company like Twitch, which live streams events. All of this infrastructure keeps the whole thing in motion, so having massive prize support for players is the very reason all of these other companies have spawned underneath a video game title.

And that’s why Valve is the number one reason I think Artifact is going to take over eSports. They know what they are doing. They organize these events. They create the prize pool for the DotA International. And they do that by offering all players the ability to buy cosmetics, with a portion of their purchases funding the actual tournament.

I put all my faith in GabeN and Valve to do this right. They’re the best in the business when it comes to this type of thing. But that’s not the only thing you need to take over eSports. You KIND OF need a good game, right? Well, let me introduce you to --

2. Dr. Richard Garfield

Is there really anything else I need to say? The man himself, the CREATOR of the modern collectible card game. If the out-of-this-world success of Magic the Gathering isn’t enough to convince you, his understanding of skill versus luck in a game should do the trick. This is an hour long presentation he gave. If you haven’t listened to it, you should do so immediately.

Many of the following reasons on my list will reference some of the concepts Dr. Garfield covers in his presentation. Also many mechanics in Artifact are built on these concepts presented here, and because of that, there isn’t much more I need to elaborate on, for now.

If you weren’t aware, Magic the Gathering is the biggest card game, ever. Despite the current drama taking place, Magic the Gathering has been the premier card game to play if you were looking to make a career out of cards. While it isn’t always a profitable career path, there are a small group of players that have raked in quite a bit of prize winnings over the years. Take a look at the Top 200 All-Time Money Leaderboards. That’s some eye-popping dollar signs, if you ask me.

But Dr. Richard Garfield doesn’t only want to cater to that tiny small percent of players, working toward big paychecks, and Magic the Gathering has recognized the different archetypes of players, known as Timmy, Johnny, and Spike. Dr. Garfield has even explained that he builds all kinds of cards, with these different player archetypes in mind.

I’d even say some of the core strategies amongst the four colors in Artifact embody a lot of the Timmy/Johnny/Spike concepts. This is important to mention because it means Dr. Garfield will cater to various playstyles in Artifact, which will allow people to be creative with their decklists, tailored to their individual style. And if you ask me, that is a recipe for some very exciting Artifact games!

So, looking at where we are now, we’ve got Valve developing a game designed by Dr. Richard Garfield. Already, that should be enough for you to believe in this game’s success. But I’m going to break it down even further. For a game to be the number one eSport, I think the most important thing has got to be the most obvious, a --

3. High Skill Ceiling

Let’s take a look at Basketball. There’s many levels of basketball, from friendly pickup games on the street, to community leagues at the local recreation center, to high school, to college, to professional foreign markets, to the very top at professional NBA basketball. In each of these levels, you would imagine anyone in one level could take on a person in a level below theirs, and beat them greater than 99% of the time. While that isn’t always the case (Haven’t you heard of The Professor?) it clearly shows the extremely high skill ceiling of Basketball, just because it can facilitate so many different levels of expertise. This isn’t a difficult concept to grasp, I just wanted to go over it briefly.

For a video game title to completely dominate the eSport world, it has to have an extremely high skill ceiling. And this is a broad concept to cover, so I’m only going to cover one aspect of it, which is the one I think defines it the greatest… Decision making.

In Artifact, the number of decisions you make, and their future impact is one of the biggest elements that separate Artifact from other card games. Within the umbrella of decision making, are concepts like Hero deployment, spending resources in one lane over another, when to give up a lane, and many other specific examples like these. (I’ll probably cover this topic directly in it’s own article at another time.)

Comparing Artifact to Hearthstone, the average number of decisions per game has to be an astronomically different number. Unfortunately, I’m not able to play Artifact currently so I can’t give you these statistics. But I’m basing this assumption off of PAX West game videos that I watched. And I think a lot of people can agree with my assumption here. If not, go ahead and tell my why you disagree in the comments.

By having so many instances where players have to make decisions, even in a perceived simple concept like initiative, your game will automatically open itself up to a high skill ceiling. Bare with me here, I’m going to break this down, as simple as I can…",2020-03-30 22:14:52

12505,fm07zf6,comment,1585648307.0,4,"Both replies disagreeing with you, but if the game:

 * Informed you ahead of time of lane spawns

 * Let you choose exactly where heroes went in a lane so you can block specific things and can actually outplay your oponnents with mindgames instead of hoping a dice does it for you 

 * Didn't have randomized game changing consumables

 * Removed all signature cards that make deckbuilding boring and samey, and converted all of them into active abilities so heroes aren't just stat sticks with a color

It'd be a game exactly as strategic as it already is, but also give you a much greater impression of actually being in control, of having better quality hands draws without having to play Legion+Axe for the 50th time, and of commanding cool, active units.

It's ridiculous to call the mechanics of a game fine, but then, the top dominating two colors are the ones that ignore them completely. Red and Blue are the two colors who can either flood the lanes (So everything points forward), can delete units or nuke towers (fuck combat, fuck you using spells, me go face) or explode entire fucking lanes (No units? No arrows! Black guy meme). Meanwhile Green, the color which absolutely requires arrow and spawn luck to grow their win conditions, is considered meme garbage and needed morbidly badly desgined, parasitic solutions like Cheating Death to even stay competitive.

Imagine Dota had Towers, but no backdoor protection, and everyone was winning by hitting the Ancients with Clinkz+Furion, and everyone plays Clinkz+Furion, defeating the purpose of the Towers. And those people playing the see people playing Crystal Maiden and Lina who have to go through the towers and going ""Nah, Dota towers are fine, they don't matter and don't ruin my games"". **That's Artifact's mechanical relevance to the top decks!** Of course people are defending it as fine. They're completely ignoring the impact of the mechanics, mechanics that only exist to screw plans and favor others with no positives, and ignoring how bad the underlying design is when you're meant to optimize it by avoiding it altogether.

And now Artifact 2.0 is probably, hopefully, going to add that Backdoor Protection, add a mechanical environment that fairer, and we'll see people cry that ""No it was fine before"", because what they loved was initiative stealing murdery big bodies that go face, and nuking lanes plus towers and pretend rounds 3-5 matter at all.",2020-03-31 09:51:47

There was no way infinite way to get 'free cards' out of Artifact. You had a set that you started with, and then it was boosters. They were rather cheap, and the monitization was that of a physical Trading Card Game, and honestly it took up less of your life to gather the cards you wanted and play. You just had to spend some real money.

Let's face it, Hearthstone and other Card Games are exploitative as all hell, consuming so much of your life with ridiculous grind, but that's what people expect. **This lack of grind was offputting to the playerbase because they expected a skinner-box and it didn't have one.**

It's like the goddamn daily and weekly quests in the battlepass all over again. It was a skinner-box element to get you on a schedule of play, and Valve got rid of it in favor of the Cavern/Jungle Crawl that didn't have hard daily timers, and doesn't program you to be a good consumer of the games reward pellets. But people cried 'oh you aren't giving us free points!' when those points were there, and didn't require constant weekly and daily engagement to get.

It wasn't that far off. Lots of stuff was recognizable and relatable for the average dota player without it being boringly similar.

And I'm pretty sure they tried but didn't really know what meta would evolve.

this is a real problem though, people these days seem to be insanely preoccupied with whether the game they're playing is the 'correct' game to be playing. You can even see it on this subreddit. Dota has literally millions of unique monthly players and even if updates stopped tomorrow it'd retain a playable playerbase for 5+ years easily and yet everyone is super concerned that dota is dead because there was a mild decrease in the average playercount.

It's why so many games are entirely dead on arrival and are unable to cultivate even a niche playerbase. People care more about seeking validation online that their game is the right choice and 'alive' than they do actually playing a game they enjoy.

For example, in MTG, red is the color of passion, anger and impulse. You see this theme reflected in mechanics of all red cards. Their spells are really cheap, their creatures have high attack and low defense, and their payoffs tend to be quick and direct rather than gaining value over time.

An analogue in Dota would be the attribute system. Agility heroes are supposed to be swift and evasive. Mechanically, their primary attribute increases their attack and movement speed.

12613,fm0kbu2,comment,1585660063.0,3,"You are correct, and Valve made a massive gamble by assuming that

>strategic depth and decision complexity == fun

which turned out to be a massive mistake. It's the same arrogance/optimism that led them to completely misread the TCG market, treating it like a bunch of Magic nerds from 2012 who have never heard the word Hearthstone.

Honestly it's for the exact same reasons that Hearthstone is reliably fun and accessible that players like me become bored of it very quickly. My favourite card game by light years is Android: Netrunner (praying it returns from the dead with Cyberpunk 2077); it's hard to imagine a more punishing, obtuse game to learn to competence, but on the other side of the token it's hard to imagine a more rewarding and interesting and engaging one. I know of no other 1v1 game with a higher strategic skill ceiling than Netrunner, period. Artifact felt like it could approach it in some ways. 

Obviously, not everyone is like me, willing to tolerate being confused and defeated over and again, sustained by small senses of scattered improvement before cracking the puzzle and finding out where the game is *really played*, having it all unfurl in my mind, making every game an intense engagement, satisfied with receiving dopamine-reward in sparser bursts, strategic milestones, mental victories, instead of a daily drip that is barely worth logging on for the rewards, but I do anyway (my current TCG life with MTGA & Runeterra). 

I believe Artifact would give back whatever you put into it, no matter who you are, but as it was in (holy shit) 2018, Artifact was definitely asking for a **LOT** from the general audience and I don't understand how Valve didn't see that too. 

So I'm excited for a return, and I hope they've found a good balance.

edit: I should add that literal coin-flip-style RNG probabilities are absolutely core to the gameplay of Netrunner. Lane arrows are nothing. And yet, despite levels of RNG the online TCG community would self-destruct over, the very best Netrunner players just *kept winning tournaments over and over again* because they're THAT good. I think we saw a bit of this in competitive Artifact too. Management of randomness (and hidden information) is where the bloody fun comes from in these games, anyway.",2020-03-31 13:07:43
12614,fm09sy3,comment,1585650338.0,2,"Not sure about this. I think Dota would be dead in a ditch with a more aggressive monetization model. The game is kept alive by its mind-breaking compexity and raw competitiveness. This appeals to a small but loyal group (us).

I think Artifact tried to attract Dota players without realizing that Dota players hate any semblance of pay-to-win like the plague and are thus a poor audience for a classic TCG - even if you can just, like, *not play constructed*. In its focus on complexity and vast strategic potential, it also totally alienated the casual audience (games were like 45mins if I remember correctly? That's a monumental commitment for a card game!).

Perhaps 10 years ago it could have become the Dota of card games and established its place as small but beloved indie-ish title. But in retrospect, the triple-A-style release was bound to fail. Both target groups, dota players and casual card game players, flocked to the game and were quickly disappointed. All the MTG folks I knew refused to even try it because they were happy with Magic. After the explosive release (explosive for a cool but immature card game, not a long-announced Valve title), the player base quickly dropped to the critical level where matchmaking breaks and then took a swift nosedive.

The game had flaws, I don't deny that at all. But if the rumors are true that Artifact 2.0 is going to be a stripped-down and simplified version (max 5 units per lane, play cards to all lanes at the same time is what I've heard) then I am extremely worried. I hope for the best but I fear that this successor may just no longer be the game I fell in love with.",2020-03-31 10:25:38

The Hardcore market is one of those hard but rewarding markets, in that getting them to buy in is difficult, but once they do they're ride or die bitches. This is why most F2P games go for the casual market, they're willing to pay for power increases.

To market to the hardcore market, you need to provide a fair engaging experience, then offer extra none gameplay affecting stuff, so the players feel as if they are the ones making the choice to spend (Goes check... fuck me) $600 on a free game.

The problem is while garfield's ideology comes across as ""pro consumer"", the fact is most of it is self justification as to why ""MTG totally isn't the original loot box, please guys I'm a good person....."". Reading his monetization logic is just... depressing.

But at its core Artifact is a hardcore game. Casual monetization strategies like MTG (And yea, MTG is a casual game, very little skill compared with luck, just wrapped behind a complex rules system to make it seem ""hardcore"") don't work with a hardcore playerbase.

12630,fm0hkjm,comment,1585657950.0,1,"Valve literally wrote the book on cosmetic microtransactions and as far as I'm aware dota 2 was the first successful battle pass implementation. So I think if anyone is able to look back on things and say ""yeah we screwed up we should have done it from the start"" it would be valve. There was obviously some (false) logic they were using to determine that artifacts business model was the correct one to go for.

The biggest mistake wasn't selling cards (although that's on it's way out now as well), it was the buy in for a model that requires scale. All free to play/microtransaction games require orders of magnitude more players than paid purchase games to be viable. So do multiplayer games such as card games as you have to feel like the investment into the cards is going to be worth it which means other people have to be playing. The issue here is that the free to play model relies on the free users to play the game en masse to convince the paid users to hand over their cash. The buy in price for artifact removes that demographic of free players and vastly diminishes the pool of players they have in the game. It essentially combines the worst aspects of two opposite business models.

There are some games that manage both, but they are usually by devs like EA or Ubisoft who throw massive marketing budgets at a title to get their targeted sales and user base and then the microtransactions are extra on top that fund the live service going forward. 

You seem to think that Garfield is some kind of god of card games and business models and even he knows this. MTG relies on the paid users (the term whale is used here often but I don't like the term) to support the wider ecosystem, people play with their friends cards, they dabble in drafts but don't have collections etc. If you had to purchase a base MTG set to buy cards it wouldn't have nearly as much success as it does.

I can see why they went the route they did though, with the card market and economy they were aiming for the major problem to solve is how to prevent new accounts and cards earned through play devaluing the economy.  So the method they choose to do that was to remove in game card earning and tie all collection of cards (including drafts and new players) to a paywall. Thus giving cards a natural scarcity and value they wouldn't have otherwise. Every card has an inherent value because it was paid for by someone.

If you truly are a dev you should know that such blind faith in ""THE"" designer is stupid. No designer is infallible and the best designers I've worked with delegate a lot to their team and draw from all of their experience and ideas (valve certainly has a lot of experience around) and use that to inform their decisions. You would never just blindly trust in the designer like some kind of messiah. In fact with someone like Garfield you'd want to be extra careful to garner a range of diverse opinions and ideas before committing to anything, as he comes from a very specific and niche background and different culture to that surrounding modern games.

Yes hindsight is 20:20, but I actually predicted the exact business model it seems like they're going for now the second they announced the game. It's valves bread and butter and the future of games.",2020-03-31 12:32:30

Most people ran Axe, or the Red heroes or whatever because they literally just **one-shot** random other Heroes.

The game needs to not have random lane set-ups or some way to alleviate the early RNG. It needs to have better balancing.

Magic sometimes goes through shitty balance moments because you can't retroactively change cards, but it's diverse enough to have decks balance each other out. Artifact was never diverse enough to balance itself out. Some things just sucked, others just bulldozed.

In Magic/Yugioh you pay for cards, then pay for events, AND there are very expensive cards that are Meta staples. Some of the Yugioh staples go for 60-80€ per card (it's nowadays lesser the case than a few years prior, but still)

Still it works and the games are loved by their huge audience. Konami/WotC make a lot of money and only get a bit of flak for these models.

You know why? Because These Cards are a kind of Investment, simillar to Fonds or stocks, you pour money in the right cards and with a bit of foresight you can make money back, or you can invest in collectors editions which only retain their value, thus shifting your Money (like with buying Gold/Diamonds). It is precicely the Trading and selling that keeps these games alive and well, as well as the (small) Chance you have to make more than your money back by opening packs.

Valve Tried to go for a simillar approach with artifact, with their own second market integrated. It is an established business model that is proven to print money, so they tried to apply it to a DCG, but the game itself was to unappealing to players, and these model live and die with their player counts (more transactions). Also there are no Insurances in artifact, if i buy an Axe, it could be changed the next patch. Meanwhile if i buy an Ultimate Rare Card in Yugioh i can bank on it to retain its value. 

All in all, getting a Meta deck in artifact through the second market (even with axe and drow in it), was still a lot cheaper than a Meta deck in Hearthstone, where these second market options dont exist, and you have to spend 80€+ every 3 months to stay competitive, with no way of getting any possible value back.",2020-03-31 09:17:15

You're correct that they were the first battle pass, yes, but they were seeking to make something entirely new for Artifact's economy.

We are certainly in agreement in Valve's mistaken assumptions - but I don't think Garfield is a god. He's had PLENTY of failures (like any good designer will), I'm saying that if you were to try to design card games without any knowledge in the field, and your focus first was on making a thriving game economy, and you got the designer who made Magic, you could assume that you had something that wouldn't flop as hard as Artifact did. They were too heads-down on parts of Artifact, but it certainly doesn't deserve the meme status it has today.

Artifact tried to move a physical card market model, the part Garfield and Valve seemed most interested in, into a digital space.... Compared to M:tG's secondhand market, it's VERY good and interesting, but they for some reason just ignored F2P entirely... And players' vehement lust for F2P in collection systems (despite it costing way more than Artifact actually does, F2P hides it way better, as I'm sure you know).

I wasn't saying they were free from all worry by working with Garfield. Ultimately, I'm saying hits-based businesses are just gambling, and making predictions of success from the future is missing 99% of the difficulty of making new things in the moment.

They haven't said much about what Artifact's model going forward *actually* is, just that you won't be buying cards. People have been plastering lots of assumptions on that one line, and assumptions are what got Artifact into this in the first place.",2020-03-31 13:06:28

12668,fm0evdy,comment,1585655589.0,2,"What's wrong with HS arena as an example? Artifact draft was main attraction too for many people. I pretty much played only f2p draft for 2 months until I finally gave up on this game. 

What was the point of discussion then if not the grind? 2nd paragraph entirely about grinding cards for free. 3rd one he even bolds it. Fourth again is about grind through dailies. I explained that grind was never an attraction in any of the games I played and I never logged in to do some quests.

r/Smarag weird assumption to make. Hearthstone was pretty much the only solid online card game for years so of course I spent a lot of time there. Never returned to ranked/arena once Gwent came out. Also played MTGA for over a year. I have been playing online card games since hearthstone beta and I am not some loyalist who plays horrible game while it's not fun anymore.

It's true that hearthstone was the most casual out of these games but what's with the slot machine joke? You know that drafts had insane RNG too in artifact compared to HS arena or we played different games? Secondly there was SO much bullshit RNG in actual gameplay which finally pushed me out of the game. Bounty hunter had coinflip RNG to be shit or be good. Then there's coinflip RNG to which direction you hit. RNG creep placements every turn etc. Every single turn there's some ""Oh yay I won coinflip"" RNG to one player while there's ""fuck this shit"" RNG for his opponent. Felt like I was just throwing a coin for 40 minutes. 

PS! Nice reply. Really contributed a lot in true redditor fashion.

EDIT: Few more notes to absolutely clarify my every point. I think it's fair to use hearthstone arena when comparing it to artifact because literally all popular tournaments in closed beta and early after game release were only draft format. How can you completely ignore artifacts most competitive and popular mode? Also I brought up battlegrounds as an example that people don't play for grind. All autochess type of games are really popular among old OCG players and none of the autochess games have grind tho you could say that dota underlords added battle pass thing so Valve is forcing grind more than any competitor :)",2020-03-31 11:53:09

(Or they were looking for something even more complex like my MTG-playing friends who essentially told me they don't like the game because it doesn't have a stack. I on the other hand love how Artifact did without one by using the passing system instead.)

To me it really seems like a lot of people had a lot of wrong expectations about the game. A free to play model could have spared some disappointment for those who ended up disliking it and given others the opportunity to even discover the game in the first place.

And once again, the game of course had issues. Lots of cards needed small tweaks and some were genuinely badly designed. Sadly a large chunk of the community wanted all cards to be balanced equally - a fundamental misconception about how TCGs and drafting work. But in my opinion the core mechanics that received so much hate (creeps and arrows) were perfectly fine and contributed very much to keeping matches interesting.

The people that can get enough out of the launch Arena are in the top ~15 percentile (or something? I don't know the actual stats). I don't know what they've done with it since then, but it was a game that took up WAY too much of my time, or required money, and the money didn't even get rid of the grind it just hastened it. 

I liked Artifact because I'm an adult with disposable income and I could build the deck I wanted without having to fuss with the mechanics of getting random cards or crafting via dust or some shit. It was very close to my experience with MTG in highschool in that regard.

But the larger playerbase for Computer TCGs wants the grinding minigames. That's the standard in the culture, and Artifact needs to replicate that in some regard to get widespread adoption. The primary gameplay loop was fun IMO, and about as strategically satisfying as MTG.",2020-03-31 19:23:06

The community will always prefer the hearthstone model because you can get a lot of value for free, like dota, even if we're willing to pay money later on when you get invested in the game.

And quite frankly the gameplay is not that enticing -- yes it's strategically deep like DotA, but after watching it id rather just play dota and that will always be a problem for artifact.  People will play a couple of games and think yeah this is cool they made a card game feel like DotA, but id rather just play dota.

I am a teacher myself (not dota), skilled and I love what I am doing. I charge by how much I feel that I am happy to work with people at a current situation.

Setmore is simple and straightforward; not many options, easy to use. SimplyBook.me has a bajillion options to customize it but is that makes it more complicated to set up. It is also a little more limited at the free tier (only 50 bookings per month before you have to pay).

There are other options by the way...

You're absolutely right, I also think my prices are kind of low. My plan was to attract attention with low prices since I couldn't see why someone would choose an unknown 7k coach from an unknown 8k coach with the same prices.

 Mmr is supposed to show a score of how good a player is at the game, and how is having a leaver in his team (being unlucky that is) make him a worse player which literally decreases the other 4 unfortunate players rank.
 Even today i had a leaver in my team who refused to switch lanes as a mid skywrath vs brood then leaves the game at minute 4 after dying once.

Exactly so why should someone lose 250 mmr for leaving a game? No matter what happens, that is not a justifiable loss of skill in 1 game. People abandon, life happens, just move on. The current system is the best one unless you can justify otherwise.",2020-03-30 20:34:10

If someone rage quits, the game was most likely already over at the point. The outcome will rarely be different if he abandons or not. Again, he might just be having a bad day. Doesn't all of a sudden make him a medal or two lower.",2020-03-30 20:48:17

12849,fly1bmn,comment,1585593719.0,3,"I dont think that there are any straightforward easy counters to him in the late game.
For the laning stage, you can  pick nuking combos like rubick mars that can spam spells and destroy his lane. A timbersaw can fare well in the lane vs him. 
In the case you only have single targets bursts/disables, a smoke gank is an excellent option to catch him off guard.
While battlefury/mjollnir/radiance/Shivas are item wise counters, they barely reveal a fat PL. It is essential for the supports to be able to kite him late game,else they die in seconds. 
One hero counter I'm yet to try but feel will work is a farmed dk with aghs. Good armor to sustain pl, and splash dmg which is extremely good.
You can also have an earthshaker core SNOWBALL and take fights when echo is up. High tempo pushing line up is also great. I'm low immortal, so I assume that higher mmr players might have better insight. But give them a try in  case you're partying up with friends",2020-03-30 18:41:59

just don't watch stuff with certain people... slacks or anyone who's a 'meme' kind of streamer does not mesh with him and it's painful to watch them together b/c purge is trying to be  serious about the game

depends a lot on what role you play and where you feel you need improvement

2 common things would be: a player with good knowledge/game sense, but they tend to get less farm, they just do better with less because they know where/when to fight and are good at that

a player who knows how to get fat, fast, but little game sense/knowledge. tend to get lots of farm if given space/time but will get ganked and might do some questionable tower dives and stuff; when they're doing well it works b/c they are so farmed it doesn't matter. strong mid players who always win lane but then get cocky later and throw are included here

first player would get a lot out of empty custom games, farming patterns and timing stuff out better to be more efficient in those times where fighting isn't ideal, rather than sitting around. second player would get a lot more out of watching pro games, learning more about the game, honing their awareness - this is where your own replays might be the best thing, what lead you to think X was a good decision and what information did you have/not have that made you make the wrong decision? how could you have known ahead of time not to do it? why did this other equally stupid decision work? maybe 3 heroes tpd bot but you didn't see, just happened to work out

and either way, watching \*player perspective\* of someone on your role/preferably the hero you're working on in either pubs or pro games. take the time to pause when they do things you're unsure about - check what vision they have, where heroes are/what level and just try to totally understand what they're doing so you can mimic it, and thru that you eventually learn through experience. but first you need to be able to mimic the good players",2020-03-30 18:19:19

12940,flyj2r1,comment,1585603089.0,2,"Lotus Orb isn't just to deflect spells. You can use to dispel yourself and your allies. It might be a stretch to buy it first against that lineup there, but it can still be useful against silences. Sky will silence you, Void Spirit usually buys Orchid... I suppose you get a Greaves instead, since it help might help your team more in teamfights, but really...? How about reading what Lotus Orb does?

Also Swashbuckler doesn't really do that much damage on it's own. Assuming you are early in the game and won't leave the lane right away, getting a quick Javelin might work too considering you can harass whoever you are up against much more.

I mean, this is really an odd thing to complain imo. I think you don't even know how to play Pango at all considering the things you are complaining here.

Swashbuckle for ranged CS, at 3 start taking medium camps near you after pushing out lane. At 6 you suddenly win the lane, because rolling thunder is amazing in the mid lane (can easily perma stun someone at runes or in the lane). 

QB branch branch faerie fire start if you’re going bottle, else you can go triple branch faerie into a sages mask + wand. Rush javelin while ferrying yourself clairities and salves; push out lane, pop a clarity and then farm nearby camps. Lane should push into your tower and you start over the process.

He gets dunked on by anti-melee heroes (huskar, razor, he’s okay vs Shaker although I don’t have a lot of experience with the matchup.) Autolose the game if you lane into qop, she shits on you from start to finish. Puck and ember are also very hard matchups but you can at least lane somewhat vs them.

What's your thought process for this...

Jungle items are great. You have the option to fight and snowball or option to farm jungle/scale/play passive.

Without jungle items it is an all in brawl with no other options. That is why jungle items were removed/patched/nerfed/buffed. To have relevance for that point in the game. 

Set items should def not be in the game. It will effect drafting enormously. 

It is a great feature to the game. If you don't like it... adapt.

Yes stupid volvo knights, I can understand that despite the luck factor of neutral items, there are skills to shape your gameplay around this item. Yes stupid volvo kngihts, I understand that anyway none of this items are that game breaking.


The thing is, I agree with you stupid volvo knights, neutral items dont break the game, theyre tolerable. But at the same time, they do not, 100% do not add meaningful strategic element to the game. I can assure you, and dont you dare lie to yourself, most people reaction to obtaining neutral items is ""oh neat, extra xx armor/attributes"". Never do someone, ""let me itemize this way so i can play around xxx neutral item when I get it ! (if i do)"".. or ""oh I just got this neutral items, by modifiying my build this way, I can totally change our team playstyle!(except its 20 mins into the game and your build is set alr"". The point is, it adds RNG but it does not give us additional strategic element. And more, some of the item is BROKEN in certain cases. Youre playing clockwork, u itemize with a surprise orchid, nice! now you can solo kill no bkb heroes! except the enemy casually got spider legs and walk out of your cog like its nothing. Or ur playing agst shaker, you shut him down in lane, nice! But then he got imp claw and suddenly wipes 500% of your Hp in one swing.

Coz that's basically what you are saying and you disregard what I was actually saying sir, while being absolutely full of shit about your understanding of poker.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a big poker fan or player, but if you consider there is 2 part in poker, you may want to actually play a game of it. Like once.

And you don't address the point I raise for you which you disregard by calling something luck: making up and adapting to RNG is a skill.

But then again, why even bother since you go with the shop idea, which isn't just bad, it's plainly going against everything about the mechanic, fully disregarding why they put them as drops in the game. Because that's the real issue, fuck ""REEE RNG items"", why did they happen?

And extra point: if you think RNG isn't a thing, you should play some dota and look up, there is [still a number of mechanics in the game that relay on that](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Random_distribution). With some as core as gold for a CS or attack damage rolls.

So there is that and going full tardo ""REEEEEE remove items"" isn't doing shit, neither acknowledging _why_ it does exist (and so what it does actually impact) nor actually be realistic about ""RNG is bad"".

And you could see how hurtful for a game it can be to have no RNG if you looked at LoL for example. With an utter will to kill RNG, it's even more of a mess than before because it became so stuck into playing a perfect game.",2020-03-30 20:08:16

Yes in poker you can count the cards, you can apply psychological attack on your opponent, you can discuise your self to make your opponent believe that you have nothing when in fact your Full House. I get it, gambling feels good, but this is a STRATEGY Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game. Luck can exist in the game as a mechanic, sure. Attacks can be ~3% different, miss chances over a hill can have a 25% chance to miss, ultimate passives with 15% chance like PA can have true RNG in them, but if you say to me that the one dude that has mediocre jungle item, has to compete with the other dude that has perfect combo with the lucky Jungle item with his hero just because ""luck"", then NO thank you, i can go to a casino and play POKER instead.

I still subconsciously consider heroes released before ~6.50 (and some released 6.50-6.60, depending on if they were played in my friends group) old, standard heroes, and those released after (especially after 6.60) to be 'new'.

The same way there are probably plenty of people that have played Dota 2 for a year, know the game really well at this point, and consider Dark Willow and Pangolier just as classic and eternal heroes as Wraith King/Skeleton King, a hero that has existed in the current form for more or less all existence of Dota.",2020-03-31 10:05:18

13379,flyy7l7,comment,1585611531.0,9,"There wasn't exactly much of a ""next item"" back then. Even if you weren't starved off resources like no tomorrow because literally every utility consumable was more expensive, the fact that the utility perishables were stupidly slot-inefficient meant that between the 2 wards, boot slot, TP slot and whatever other stuff your team needed(dust mostly, maybe smoke if you were tryharding... nobody smoked in beta noob Dota), you quite simply lacked the space for anything other than maybe some cheap stats to not die to AOE collateral damage every fight. And I'm not even a WC3 boomer, I'm sure it was even worse before Dota 2.

If game's going to shit buying mana boots was probably often the best you could do. Helps your brainlet str cores(which used to be manastarved much harder), helps your own manapool, saves you a slot and used to give you a teeny tiny bit more movement speed. Tranquils used to be kinda dogshit(basically reusable Healing Salve instead of the godlike budget Heart + out-of-combat sprint it is today) so the only real alternative was Treads, which was nice stats to have but ultimately not as gamechanging as giving somebody with low mana another cast in a bind(and besides Wand has been an awesome budget item since basically forever and could drag you through the toughest spots if charged).

'course, this is really so long ago. Maybe I am misremembering. But dedicated supp life really was so horrendous anyway few played it 100% straight to begin with. Even the most altruistic people generally at least played like 4s and got a Blink or an Aghs before going full communist lifestyle because having items is fun, kinda like modern pub Dota really. However, I don't think that's really happening if the other team is already running your house in and you haven't even moved from brown boots. You're basically already playing full communist life, might as well itemize for it.",2020-03-30 23:38:51

13471,flxibya,comment,1585583456.0,1,"Well if we get 7.23 out of the equation, this is an ""Quality of life"" addition to the game. The Core mechanics in the game can be rebalanced and i strongly believe rescaled. If we watch the updates we get Amplifcations and Reductions through out of the mechanics. It is time i believe it is explained. This can start with the start of the intoduction of a 4th element. Wisdom, Willpower, Charisma, Talent, Persuation, Bluff, Diplomacy, Trickery, Knowledge. All that can be filled into the game with the 4th attribute. And about the cancerous games right now, remember that the schools are closed unfortunately, so try to play with friends and not rank",2020-03-30 15:50:56
13472,flxkf5e,comment,1585584620.0,1,"Yeah thats why i strongly beleve that the Addition of Wisdom in the game will make it so much easier. Lots of mechanics are not even attached to Attributes while other are. Those can be easily fixed if assigned to the right attribute. All mechanics need Amplification and Reduction. From how many summons u can summon to how much damage u absorve, how many seconds you are stunned, how much is your AoE, and so on and so forth, should all be linked back to the attributes. But when you have only 3 you cant do that,,, Gameplay needs rebalance. This was what the ""rebalance"" update at 7.23 was supposed to do. Instead we got 2534 random jungle items, destroyng game balance.",2020-03-30 16:10:20
13473,flxhh28,comment,1585582980.0,1,"I will just throw words and terms in there because all we can do is theorize. 

If 4th element is Wisdom/Charisma/Willsave and we take as basic the RPG Gerne in general then :

Wis (Wisdom, Charisma, Willsave): 

CoolDown, Magic Resist, Status Ampl, Summons, Heal Ampl, AoE Ampl, All Damage Ampl/Reductioon, Accuracy, sleep, root, blink

Now what will Change in the rest Attributes:

Str (Which is actually both Strenth and Constitution in tabletop terms) 

HP, HP regen, Physical Damage Amp/Red, Status Resistance, Damage Block, damage Return, stun, Disable

Dex (which in tablertop is Dexterity but also Reflex saves and general ""acrobatic"" skills)

Attack Speed, Attack Rate, Miss/Reflexes/Armor, Movement Speed, Criticals, Passive Breaks, Silences, Manaburn, escape

13580,flyth69,comment,1585608774.0,1,"just a crusader (now, almost guardian...) passing by, but here's my two cents:


if you join teamfights as alch with just your sole radiance, then you will probably get kited a lot, killed with ease, and destroyed in every way (as you don't have mobility (blink/sb), tankiness/sustain (bkb/ac), crowd control (basher/scythe/abyssal)), so I guess that it's almost never worth to join a teamfight as alch, unless it's absolutely situational.



yeah, common mid heroes should have at least some small game impact with not a lot of farm (od, storm, puck, TA, ember spirit, void spirit, monkey king). but alchemist is a different case, as he's basically a mid-to-late game carry, because of how your passive works, blablabla, you know that stuff.



if your team can make enough space to give you at least 30 minutes of farming, then yeah, you should be able to have impact on teamfights normally.


So, i would just keep farming in almost every case, as it's the best you can do for your team (alch with radiance is just not a risk for enemy team). Anyways, if your barracks are being taken down, then you should join your team (just for avoiding reports lol).",2020-03-30 22:52:54

The rest of the time, you need to be able to survive morph's shotgun burst. Glimmer, pipe, and bkb will help with this.

13614,flzk4rs,comment,1585625627.0,4,"1. Not very. It might help you learn what move heroes have, but beyond that it isn't great. Teamfighting can be different too because farm distribution is usually different in real games.
2. Mask of Madness is a lot better on him, adds damage in chrono really well and better for farming. Diffusal is also a lot stronger in general. Echo doesn't scale well compared to these other items, and is only good if you plan to fight a lot early, which void doesn't want to do.
3. No idea, but probably not
4. Most games positions are distributed so that the pos 1 goes to safelane and pos 3 goes to offlane, but you don't have to do it like that. Position refers to how farmed the hero plans on getting, and this doesn't have to match up to lanes. In many pro games they put the hard carry in the offlane. 

As the name implies, safelane is a lot safer. This is because of the shape of the lane, the location the creeps meet being close to the safelane tower, and the locations of the pull camps. Often a hero goes safelane because they won't be able to farm safely anywhere else. For example, a drow could have a lot of trouble farming in the offlane, because the enemies could run her down and kill her. In the safelane, she can hit creeps near the safety of her tower. On the flipside, an offlane hero is usually one that can farm somewhat safely in the more dangerous location of the offlane. They are often also heroes that can put a lot of pressure on carries, because carries have to farm the safelane a lot of the time, if they are pressured there they will have a hard time in game. 

The other reason to put someone safelane is so they have space to run down and kill enemies. Heroes like ursa, slardar, and weaver really benefit from this, because they can threaten kills if they are able to chase enemies.

As well, lanes are chosen to try to get good lane matchups against enemy heroes",2020-03-31 03:33:47

13682,flx8xmh,comment,1585577955.0,1,"That's wayyy too strong. Most of his character is built around doing high rot damage to both him and enemies. 

For rot to not damage him without being insanely OP, the damage in general would have to be *severely* reduced. Because of that it will no longer serve it's purpose, and nor would flesh heap or dismember. Coupled with the lowered damage no longer allowing decent killing/farming power, this actually comes out to a big nerf.

IMO an interesting change would be to have a toggle for ""orientation"" of the hook. Either it's slightly thicker and slower, or thinner and faster. But even this would throw off the visuals, and probably mess with the alrdy borked hookboxes. Shit idea, but interesting maybe lol.

Realistivally: I'd like to see his aghs reworked. I've literally never seen his current aghs played, not once. I think either some sort of buff to ROT would be good, or add an extra spell that lets him properly devour enemies (like his current aghs but eat an enemy and deal damage). It would (essentially) work the same as Stitches Devour ult from HotS.",2020-03-30 14:19:15
13683,flxpmna,comment,1585587436.0,1,"Well, that means rot will become free spell (no manacost, no CD) so no.

I feel like Pudge with +HP regen on Flesh heap make Pudge decent enough but icefrog revert that back to magic resis for some reason.

IMO buff Pudge starting armor by 1 or 2 to make him better at tanking physical damage. Right now with no HP regen from Flesh heap he's so easy to harass. All you need to bully Pudge in lane is 1 blight stone.

Also maybe Aghs rework. Right now it's fucking weird. It basically just a melee range Phoenix Aghs without CD refresh.",2020-03-30 16:57:16

13767,fm0ny1m,comment,1585662548.0,2,"Abuse creep aggro vs those heroes. That & good use of her splash early on

Refraction is basically viewed as a damage buff only, its defensive properties are obviously not useful. Get whatever cs you can, take the 1 creep trade to go stack jungle b/c that’s how you win the lane. All of those very single target focused heroes are good vs ta in the actual lane,but their downside is that they can’t flash farm. Also with meld they shouldn’t kill you under tower, it’ll die eventually but your goal is slow that down as much as you can while blowing up the jungle when tower isn’t being hit. Also huskar in particular, viper somewhat but less so, is not especially threatening in early levels, it’s 3+ that they start really being a pain, 5 is very scary and a big kill threat time. but you can deal a Lot of harass early with your splash. By the time they are an actual kill threat and not just a pain in the ass, you should have enough to transition to primarily jungling while making a fat ancient stack

So, first few levels are more important than you might think. If you don’t get enough for boots and wraith band by the time you need to step away, your jungling time is way harder and you probably will be behind all game. If you get a good start, sometimes you even are able to stay in lane, if not you jungle fast enough you can theoretically outfarm&outlevel them if they are only taking lane creeps and you get 1 or 2 per wave + a bunch of jungle creeps

So to do that would be your second question which is way harder to answer.. how to jungle properly. It’s about rotation, minimizing downtime, which all comes from experience. Thru practice you get a feel for what items you have, how long that means this camp takes and you get a feel for when lane creeps show up, so you finish a jungle camp and you’re right by the lane and then you clear another camp and now you’re right at the ancient camp you want to stack at :5x... it takes practice and clock/lane awareness which are very experience based and hard to just, explain to someone i guess",2020-03-31 13:49:08
